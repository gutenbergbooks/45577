<h1 title="">BETTY&rsquo;S HAPPY YEAR</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">I</span>
<br />A THANKSGIVING GUEST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What a gorgeous day for a sleigh-ride! Did you
ever see such sunny, twinkling snow, and such
crisp, crackly air? It fairly snaps off as you breathe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty McGuire stood on the steps of the veranda as she
spoke. Her mother, in the doorway, was smiling down at
her, and her pony, Dixie, was jingling his bells and pawing
at the snow and ice in the driveway below.</p>
<p>It was the first trial of the pretty new cutter, and the
joyous excitement of the occasion made Betty&rsquo;s cheeks
as red as her scarlet tam-o&rsquo;-shanter cap, or her red cloth
coat with its high fur collar. Betty drew on her driving-gloves,
still talking to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a darling sleigh, Mother? Did you ever see
such a pretty one? And Dixie is so proud of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beauty, Betty. I know you&rsquo;ll enjoy it. Are you
taking Tilly for a ride?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;m going for May Fordham to-day. We&rsquo;re planning
for the party, you know. I&rsquo;ll take Tilly some other
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; be home by sundown, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; or very soon after. All right, Pete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face of the big Irishman beamed with pleasure as
he assisted Betty into the new sleigh and tucked the fur
robe round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a foine turnout, Miss Betty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;an&rsquo; mosht
becomin&rsquo; to Dixie,&mdash;the proud little baste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is proud of it,&rdquo; agreed Betty, as she gathered up
the lines. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just vain enough to love those silver bells
jingling about him. Good-by, Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, darling,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, and after watching
Betty disappear down the winding drive, she returned
to the house.</p>
<p>Denniston Hall, though a beautiful summer place, was
equally attractive in winter. Then the wide front veranda
was inclosed with glass, and, heated by an arrangement
of steam-pipes, made a delightful sun-parlor. The house
was of the old-fashioned type that has two front doors
opening into two large halls.</p>
<p>Large parlors between these halls and a wing on either
side, provided numerous rooms, and several of these boasted
wide fireplaces where crackling logs blazed gaily or smoldered
comfortably, as occasion required.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>The family at Denniston was a rather unusual one. The
place belonged to Betty, the fifteen-year-old daughter, who
had recently inherited a large fortune from her Grandfather
McGuire.</p>
<p>She had supposed herself an orphan, but after buying
her home and establishing herself there, she had discovered
that her mother was living, and, to their mutual
delight, they were at last brought together. Mrs. McGuire
had come to Denniston to live with Betty and was more
than willing to accept also Betty&rsquo;s adopted brother, Jack,
and the three-year-old baby, Polly.</p>
<p>And now, though Mrs. McGuire was nominally head
of the household, yet, as the details of housekeeping were
looked after by capable Mrs. Kinsey, Betty&rsquo;s mother had
little to do except to enjoy the reunion with her long-lost
child. As for Betty, now that her mother was restored to
her, there seemed to be no flaw in her happiness, and the
merry girl danced gaily through life, like a ray of glad
sunshine.</p>
<p>Unused to advice or restraint of any sort, she could not
at once accustom herself to asking her mother&rsquo;s permission
for anything, but Mrs. McGuire appreciated the unusual
circumstances, and wisely concluded to bide her time, and
establish their rightful relationship by degrees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Moreover, she was so happy herself, at the reunion with
her idolized child, whom she had lost as a tiny baby, that
she had no wish to dictate or to interfere with Betty&rsquo;s
plans. Mrs. McGuire was a gentle little lady, with golden
hair and blue eyes, and her amiability made her beloved by
all the servants and adored by the three children. She
had fitted into her niche at Denniston without disturbing
any one else, and had supplied the one want of Betty&rsquo;s
life, that of a real mother, who would love her with real
mother-love. And happy in the knowledge and possession
of this love, Betty felt that life had no further joys to
offer her; and she was as contented as any girl of fifteen
could wish to be.</p>
<p>On this particular sunny afternoon, as she went skimming
along the white roads in her new sleigh, her mind
was divided between the actual delights of the bracing
winter atmosphere and gay jingle of her new sleigh-bells,
and her busy imagination which was looking forward to
some fine plans that she and May Fordham had in prospect.
She drove in through the open gates of a large,
well-kept place, and as she neared the house, May, who
had watched from the window, came out, all ready for the
sleigh-ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty, what a beautiful cutter!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
as Dixie paused and stood in prancing attitude to be
praised. &ldquo;And it suits Dix perfectly, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
added, patting the pony, who showed by his actions that
he fully appreciated the applause he was getting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/i017.jpg" alt="&ldquo;OH, BETTY, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CUTTER!&rdquo; MAY EXCLAIMED" width="500" height="367" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;OH, BETTY, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CUTTER!&rdquo; MAY EXCLAIMED</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>May jumped in beside Betty, and in another moment,
away they went, flying along the firm, well-packed road.
Betty turned away from the village, and toward the open
country, where they might dash over long stretches without
meeting much traffic, and thus have a better chance to
chatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanksgiving&rsquo;s only just a week from to-day,&rdquo; said
May; &ldquo;will there be time, Betty, to get everything
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to fly round, of course. But if we
invite everybody to-day, they can all get to work on their
costumes at once. And a week&rsquo;s time enough, I should
think. I hope Tilly will like the idea, but I don&rsquo;t know
about her,&mdash;she&rsquo;s such a fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; laughed May, as Dixie was gently
drawn to a standstill in front of Tilly Fenn&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>The well-trained little pony always stood without being
tied, so the girls jumped from the sleigh and ran up the
steps, moderating their gay laughter as they decorously
pushed the door-bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up to my room, girls,&rdquo; called Tilly, over the
banister, as they were admitted.</p>
<p>So in a few moments the three chums were busily talking
of Betty&rsquo;s project.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A real old-fashioned Thanksgiving party,&rdquo; said Betty,
enthusiastically; &ldquo;everything Puritan, you know. We&rsquo;ll
all wear plain gray dresses and white fichus and aprons,
and dear little Puritan caps, and the boys must rig up the
right kind of clothes. What did men wear then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, knee-breeches and long stockings, and bunches
of bows at the knees,&rdquo; said May, who was a history lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and broad white collars, and sort of Norfolky
jackets, and broad-brimmed hats,&rdquo; added Tilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a feather?&rdquo; suggested Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; not a feather,&mdash;I think,&mdash;that isn&rsquo;t Puritanish.
But a buckle,&mdash;I think,&mdash;well, anyway we can
look up pictures, and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Betty, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll fix up Jack&rsquo;s clothes.
Mother&rsquo;ll help me. Then we&rsquo;ll have the feast of the real
old-timey kind. Baked beans, you know,&mdash;and doughnuts,
and cider,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pumpkin-pies,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nuts and gingerbread;&mdash;it will be lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like it,&rdquo; said Tilly, a little hesitatingly, &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t know about a dress. Aunt won&rsquo;t help me,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sure;&mdash;and I simply can&rsquo;t make one myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure Mother&rsquo;ll
make you one, if you can&rsquo;t get one any other way. But
perhaps you could borrow one. The old Adams ladies have
lots of old-fashioned clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, maybe I could,&rdquo; and Tilly&rsquo;s eyes brightened at
this way out of her difficulty. &ldquo;And I can make brown
bread for the feast. That&rsquo;s old-fashioned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll provide all the supper,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;because
it&rsquo;s my party. And afterward, we&rsquo;ll have old-fashioned
dances, with a fiddler to call out the figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the Puritans danced,&rdquo; said Tilly.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care to keep it too
Puritanic,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have it as old-fashioned
as we like, and have the rest any way we want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the best,&rdquo; said May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your table must look old-fashioned,&mdash;with candles,
you know; Aunt&rsquo;ll lend you her old brass candlesticks if
you want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do; and I know where I can borrow some old
blue dishes and pewter platters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it will be lovely fun!&rdquo; sighed May. &ldquo;How many
are you going to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty. I don&rsquo;t believe Jack will care much
about dressing up&mdash;he hates it; but I&rsquo;ll coax him to. Well,
come on, May, we must go and invite the others. Don&rsquo;t
worry about your dress, Tilly. If you can&rsquo;t borrow one,
Mother and I will fit you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. You&rsquo;re a dear, Betty; I wish you&rsquo;d let me
make brown bread for you, though. I can make it to
perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Betty,&rdquo; said May, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
have a sort of &lsquo;Harvest Home.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re lovely and picturesque.
You make a great big pile of things like cabbages
and pumpkins and potatoes, and decorate it with
corn husks and things; and then, don&rsquo;t you see, we can
all bring something for it, and afterward we can give the
eatables to the poor people in &lsquo;The Hollow.&rsquo; And Tilly
can donate some brown bread to them, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll ask everybody
to bring something for the Harvest Home, and then the
next day we can all make the round of The Hollow in the
big box-sleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know some families down there who would be
more than glad to get things like that,&rdquo; said Tilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And well may anybody be glad to get the good bread
you make,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to-morrow, Tilly, to
take you for a ride in my new sleigh, and then we can talk
about your dress for the party and other things to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gay good-bys were said, and the two girls went jingling
away in the sleigh again.</p>
<p>Tilly was not so happily situated in life as Betty and
May. She lived with an aunt who, though she took good
care of her, was not very sympathetic in the matter of
young people&rsquo;s pleasures, and taught Tilly to sew and to
make bread, because she considered such things the important
part of a girl&rsquo;s education. And she was right
enough in that, if she had only realized that a girl of
fifteen wants and needs her share of fun as well as of useful
knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>

<p class="center">&ldquo;HELLO, GIRLS,&rdquo; HE CALLED, AS HIS SMILING FACE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Moreover, Mrs. Fenn was not wealthy, and though she
had had sufficient means for comfort, she was economical
by nature, and would have considered a purchase of a
dress for Tilly to wear just for one occasion, a reckless
extravagance.</p>
<p>But in spite of her aunt&rsquo;s restrictions, Tilly was a very
gay and merry girl, and was always one of the half dozen
that composed Betty&rsquo;s little clan of friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the boys will dress up,&rdquo; said May, as
they drove back to the village to deliver more invitations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they can stay home,&rdquo; said Betty, promptly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
going to be a lovely party if everybody takes interest in it,
and those who don&rsquo;t take an interest aren&rsquo;t wanted. Now,
we&rsquo;ll go to Agnes Graham&rsquo;s, and see what she and Stub
say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes said yes at once, and declared that she could
fix up a dress as easily as anything. &ldquo;Come in, Stub,&rdquo; she
called to her brother who was in the next room; &ldquo;somebody
wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stub Graham was so nicknamed because he was the
thinnest and scrawniest boy you ever saw. He was very
tall for his age, and the name of Stub or Stubby was so
comical that it pleased his friends to use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, girls,&rdquo; he called, as his smiling face appeared
in the doorway. &ldquo;What, Betty, a party? Will I come?
Well, I should say so! When is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Stub festooned his length along a sofa and gave a
brotherly tweak to Agnes&rsquo;s long, thick pigtail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Thanksgiving night,&rdquo; said Betty, and then she
told him what kind of a party it was to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gay!&rdquo; exclaimed Stub. &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll get up a rig.
Sweet little sister will help me, and I&rsquo;ll be a regular Miles
Standish or somebody like that. May I wear a cloak, I
mean a golfcapey thing? I think they wore those in
Puritan days, with a dinky white collar, like Fauntleroy&rsquo;s
only without lace on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Stub!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;You have just
the right ideas! Can&rsquo;t you help the other boys,&mdash;if they
need help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! I&rsquo;ll get them all together, and if they don&rsquo;t
learn quickly enough, I&rsquo;ll be a dressmaker to &rsquo;em. And
I&rsquo;ll help you fix your show, Betty. You ought to have
strings of red peppers and onions hung across overhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do help me, Stub! Won&rsquo;t you and Agnes come
over in the morning, and help me do those things? Oh,
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> we have fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that it was easy. Very few of the girls they invited
made any objection to wearing the Puritan costume,
and if the boys objected, as some did, they were referred
to Stub Graham, who soon changed their minds for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be perfectly beautiful, Mother!&rdquo; said
Betty, as, after dinner that evening, she sat on a low stool
at her mother&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>This was Betty&rsquo;s favorite position, for, though a big
girl, she loved to cuddle against her mother and caress
her pretty hand, or play with the laces and ribbons of her
dainty gown. And now, in their beautiful drawing-room
at Denniston, they sat before the big open fire, while Betty
told about the party.</p>
<p>Jack, who lounged in a big chair on the other side of
the fireplace, was greatly interested. To Betty&rsquo;s surprise he
was entirely willing to wear a Puritan costume, though he
observed, incidentally, he&rsquo;d rather dress as an Indian, and
Indians were quite as appropriate to the period as Puritans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they didn&rsquo;t attend the Thanksgiving feasts,&rdquo; said
Betty; &ldquo;they lurked in the ambushes; so if you want to
do that, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;I believe you think an ambush is
a kind of a shrub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, isn&rsquo;t it, Mother?&rdquo; asked Betty, turning her big
dark eyes confidingly to her mother&rsquo;s loving face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my girlie, that&rsquo;s one of your funny mistakes.
But you&rsquo;re right about the Indians not joining with the
Puritans at table; at least, they didn&rsquo;t often do so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Both Betty and Jack had been deprived of early education,
and though they were now studying very hard in a
brave endeavor to &ldquo;catch up&rdquo; to other children of their
own age, they frequently made errors which were quite
funny enough to make any one smile.</p>
<p>So Jack good-naturedly explained to Betty about Indians
in ambush, which was a subject he had quite thoroughly
studied in his history lessons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I can&rsquo;t be an Indian,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be a
Puritan gentleman. Grandma Jean will make my toggery;
I&rsquo;ll tell her just how, and I&rsquo;ll make you proud of me,
Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandma Jean was Mrs. Kinsey, the housekeeper and
general assistant to the children, whenever they needed
her capable aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what shall I wear, Mother?&rdquo; asked Betty, draping
the soft frills of her mother&rsquo;s trailing gown across her
own slippered feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll have to be the &lsquo;Puritan maiden, Priscilla,&rsquo;
though you&rsquo;re far from the right type. Your dark
curls, dancing eyes, and red cheeks ought to be pale, fair
hair in smooth bands, and a pale face with meek eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; laughed Jack, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not very Puritanic, are
you, Betty? But you&rsquo;ll look all right in a cap, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll make you a dress of gray silk,&rdquo; went on
Mrs. McGuire; &ldquo;with a soft mull fichu crossed on your
breast, and a starched cap, turned back in Puritan fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like red,&rdquo; observed Betty, looking down at her own
red cashmere frock with black velvet bows on it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not for Puritan attire,&rdquo; said her mother, smiling.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix your costume, Betty, and you must promise
not to slip up-stairs and add a red sash at the last
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s fondness for bright colors, and especially red,
was a household word, and Mrs. McGuire fancied that
the novelty of plain dove-gray and white would not be
unbecoming to rosy-cheeked Betty.</p>
<p>For the next few days nothing was talked of but the
old-fashioned party.</p>
<p>Pete was consulted about the Harvest Home part of it,
and he suggested that an old flower stand which was out
in the tool house should be painted up, and put in one end
of the dining-room to hold the donations of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Then, by adding a few vines and flowers, it could be
made an attractive decoration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be just the thing! We
can put pumpkins and cabbages down below, and apples
and potatoes in the upper shelves, and trail vines over
them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen, the cook, was quite willing to make all sorts of
goodies that were deemed appropriate, and to the lists
of baked beans and gingerbread, were added such satisfactory
dishes as roast turkey and pumpkin-pie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>But no ice-cream or dainty salads or bonbons were allowed,
for Betty wanted to keep the real atmosphere of a
plain old-fashioned Puritan Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Preparations went busily on, until on Tuesday a letter
came from Grandfather Irving.</p>
<p>He was the father of Mrs. McGuire, and lived in Boston.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Irving had been invited long ago to
spend Thanksgiving at Denniston, but had declined because
of another engagement.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Irving wrote, the other engagement had been
canceled, and they were greatly pleased to say they could
go to Denniston after all. Moreover, he announced, they
would bring with them a charming young lady who was
visiting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is an English girl,&rdquo; Mr. Irving wrote, &ldquo;Miss
Evangeline Maxwell. As she is sixteen years old, she will
prove a delightful companion for Betty, and I am glad to
show her such an attractive portion of our country, as I
am sure Denniston must be. She has never visited
America before, and though she finds some of our ways
strange, she tries to adapt herself to them. We will
arrive on Wednesday afternoon about four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty read this letter with dismay. Mr. and Mrs. Irving
were of an old and aristocratic Boston family, and Betty
rather stood in awe of them. They had not yet been to
Denniston, but Betty had made a brief visit to their Boston
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The somewhat oppressive grandeur of the great house
on Commonwealth Avenue made a strong impression on
simple-minded Betty, and she had determined that when
Mr. and Mrs. Irving should visit her at Denniston she
would do all in her power to surround them with the careful
formality they seemed to enjoy.</p>
<p>So when she learned that on the very next day not only
Mr. and Mrs. Irving would arrive, but also a strange young
lady from England, Betty wished she had more time for
preparation.</p>
<p>It was in vain that Mrs. McGuire told her that her
grandparents were not at all exacting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mother and Father and I
used to spend our summers down in that old country house
of the Rosses&rsquo;, and do you suppose there was much form
or ceremony there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Betty was not to be turned aside from her purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be ashamed not to do the right honor by my grandfather
and grandmother,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not but
what my home is good enough, and my ways of living,
but I must not have the foolish party I was going to have.
I must have a fine and bountiful Thanksgiving dinner,
with soups and fancy ice-creams and things with French
names to &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;d not set before them the baked beans
and pumpkin-pies, at all. And I&rsquo;d not have a rollickin&rsquo;
crowd of boys and girls dressed up in the silly rags we&rsquo;re
thinkin&rsquo; of!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>It was only when Betty grew very much excited that she
neglected her final g&rsquo;s and <i>almost</i> relapsed into her long-discarded
Irish accent. But she was so earnest in this
matter, that she lost control of her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d think shame for the stylish English girl to
see such cuttin&rsquo;s up, so I would! They&rsquo;re all right for
us Greenborough girls as likes &rsquo;em; but the fine young
lady shall find accommodations more to her taste, that
I&rsquo;m bound!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so what did impulsive Betty do but jump into her
little sleigh, and fly round the village, recalling her invitations
to a Puritan Thanksgiving feast, and asking the
young people to come instead to a dance in the evening,
and to wear their prettiest and most correct party frocks.
Then she consulted with her mother and Ellen and Mrs.
Kinsey, and among them they planned a dinner that
would have pleased the most fastidious diners-out in
any city. Betty did not herself know the names of the
dishes she wanted served, but the services of a competent
caterer were to be assisted by the skilled work of the home
servants, and Betty felt that she had done the best she
could to honor her relatives with a Thanksgiving feast.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire tried to persuade her not to give up the
Puritan party, but Betty was firm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, with snapping eyes; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have
the English young lady making fun of our country games.
I&rsquo;ll give her as good as she has in her own country, and I&rsquo;ll
do the best I can for my grandparents as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; declared Jack. &ldquo;Here
I&rsquo;ve the loveliest brown cloth rig you ever saw. Cloak and
knickerbockers and buckled slippers! Why, Betty, your
grand Miss Maxwell would like me a heap better in those
togs than in my Tuxedo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty faltered for an instant, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she would, Jack; but the girls and boys haven&rsquo;t
all such fine costumes. Some are just fixed up out of
cheese-cloth and waterproofs. No, sir, it isn&rsquo;t right by
quality people to give &rsquo;em the kitcheny things we were
going to have to eat at the feast, and if we leave out the
old-fashioned dinner, there&rsquo;s no fun in the old-fashioned
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack, who always bowed to Betty&rsquo;s
commands and never presumed to dictate.</p>
<p>And Betty was honest in her motives. It was not at
all pride in her handsome home and its beautiful appointments
that influenced her; it was the impulse to give
of her very best to honor her dear grandparents and their
young guest, and it was a more severe disappointment than
any one knew, for her to give up the gay and jolly party
she had planned for.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>But Betty&rsquo;s determination was of the immovable kind,
and every plan for the Puritan party was dropped, and
every plan for the proper reception of the guests was pushed
forward; and so ably was all this done, that, on Wednesday
afternoon, the house was in readiness and the family, in
holiday attire, awaited their guests.</p>
<p>The Denniston carriage brought them from the station,
and the reunion was a most happy one.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Irving may have seemed a bit punctilious
as to the formal routine of their own house, but that
in no way interfered with their hearty expressions of
pleasure at finding themselves under their granddaughter&rsquo;s
roof. And they soon showed both by joyous words and
manner that they were genuinely glad to meet Jack and
Baby Polly and Grandma Kinsey.</p>
<p>Miss Maxwell was not quite as Betty had pictured her.
She was quiet and reserved, but she seemed shy rather
than haughty.</p>
<p>Betty tried hard to draw her out, but the English girl
replied in monosyllables, and though most courteous and
polite, was bafflingly unresponsive to the cordial chatter
of both Jack and Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iceberg!&rdquo; thought Jack, to himself; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good
notion to say Boo! and see if she&rsquo;d jump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t, for Jack was always on his good behavior
when Betty wanted him to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Dinner passed off beautifully. Of course, this was not
the grand feast,&mdash;that was for to-morrow; but the well-cooked
and well-served family dinner was a credit to
Betty&rsquo;s household. The evening was a little stiff. All sat
primly on the brocaded chairs in the drawing-room and
made polite conversation; but there was a certain restraint,
which, however, Betty accepted as a necessary result of
&ldquo;having company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last they all went to bed, and Betty lay awake, wondering
whether it could be her fault that Miss Maxwell
didn&rsquo;t seem to be enjoying herself. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her mother,
to whom Betty confided her anxiety in a little bedtime
chat. &ldquo;No, dearie, it isn&rsquo;t your fault, except that perhaps
you&rsquo;re a little overanxious about it all. Perhaps if you&rsquo;d
take Miss Maxwell a little more simply,&mdash;a little more as
you take May Fordham or Tilly Fenn,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, I couldn&rsquo;t talk to Miss Maxwell as&mdash;as
jokingly as I talk to the other girls! Why, even her name
is Evangeline!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire smiled, as she kissed Betty good night.
&ldquo;It is an imposing name,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but try not to be
afraid of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next morning, Betty did try. She took Miss Maxwell
for a sleigh-ride, but they did not make much progress
toward chumminess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>It was after luncheon, when the girls went up to Betty&rsquo;s
room for a little chat, that Betty, more perplexed than
ever, involuntarily blurted out her anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you like this at home?&rdquo; she said, scarcely realizing
that the question was extremely personal. &ldquo;Do you
never chum with people?&rdquo; Miss Maxwell broke into a
ringing laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the chummiest thing in the world,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
love to be chums with you, but I&rsquo;m so&mdash;so afraid of
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of <i>me</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, opening her dark
eyes wide in astonishment. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s scared to death
I am of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then both girls went off into peals of laughter, for
Betty&rsquo;s quick wit caught the real state of the case, and
Evangeline, too, saw the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you so grand I must be extra polite,&rdquo;
said Betty, as they became calm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought because you were the owner of this
big house, I must behave with great dignity! Please be
chums. May I call you Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope so! I&rsquo;m still too much afraid to say
Evangeline, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Van, then; lots of my friends do, and I like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love it! It makes us friends at once. I think it
was the &lsquo;Evangeline&rsquo; part of you that scared me most.
Why, when I heard that, I made the boys and girls give
up our baked beans dinner, and have lobster p&acirc;t&eacute;s
and souffl&eacute;e meringue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baked beans dinner! What do you mean? My!
but that sounds jolly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Betty told Evangeline of the Puritan party that had
been set aside because of the unexpected guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a shame!&rdquo; cried Van. &ldquo;I should have <i>loved</i>
it; can&rsquo;t you get it up again? I can scrabble up a frock,
I&rsquo;m sure! It would be so <i>much</i> more fun than a grand
dinner! oh, a thousand times more! Pumpkin-pie and
cider and candle-light! Oh! Oh! <i>Can&rsquo;t</i> you get it
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I could, Van. It&rsquo;s after two now, and
dinner&rsquo;s at seven. But let&rsquo;s try. Jack! Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack came at Betty&rsquo;s call, and he was informed of the
wonderful discoveries the two girls had made concerning
each other. He looked a little disgusted at Betty&rsquo;s lack
of intuition in the matter, and said: &ldquo;Whew! what queer
things girls are!&rdquo; but he accepted the new situation, and
set his wits to work to help Betty out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should think we could manage it somehow,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Give Pete and Ellen charge of the dinner part
of it; send word to your gorgeous caterer man that the
dinner is postponed; and you, Betty, hop into the cutter
and fly round and tell those who haven&rsquo;t any telephone,
while I stay here and call up all those who have. I&rsquo;ll
wager they&rsquo;ll all come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Come they did, every one of them. They wore quaint
Puritan costumes, which were delightful to look at, if
they were made of such humble materials as cheese-cloth
and silkoline. The boys were stunning in their picturesque
suits, and the dining-room was truly old-fashioned
with its onions and red peppers strung from the rafters.
The homely viands were eaten with decided enjoyment,
and afterward even old Mr. Irving joined in the Virginia
Reel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Betty, as she and Van went to their
rooms after the party was over, &ldquo;that I learned of your
ability to &lsquo;chum,&rsquo; before it was too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, too,&rdquo; said her English guest; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have missed this experience for anything. I shall always
remember what is probably the only Thanksgiving party
I shall ever attend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">II</span>
<br />A CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;Christmas will be
fun, whatever we do; but I mean I&rsquo;d like to do
something specially exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo; demanded Jack, her adopted brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; I can&rsquo;t think of anything. But we
can have a party here any time; I&rsquo;d like to go somewhere
else for the day&mdash;somewhere where there&rsquo;s something to
see and do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restless little Betty,&rdquo; said her mother, smiling. &ldquo;Well,
what do you think of going to Lakewood for a few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked dubious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lakewood is lovely,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I do want to go
there again sometime; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem just right for
Christmas. I want to do something more&mdash;more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rackety,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, more gay and festive. I&rsquo;d like to fly to the North
Pole in an air-ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With flags waving and bands playing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun? What could we do,
Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Her mother caressed Betty&rsquo;s curly head and smiled
indulgently at her, as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think a minute. There must be plenty of
places if you&rsquo;re bent on going away somewhere. How
about New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s just right!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go to
New York to spend Christmas, and see the beautiful
things there. Oh, <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> we have fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes fairly shone with delighted anticipation, and
she threw a sofa-pillow at Jack to stir him to greater
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Sleepyhead!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s
plan it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;you might invite
Agnes Graham and her brother to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! That will be grand! We&rsquo;ll have the
greatest time anybody ever had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious!&rdquo; said Jack, roused to enthusiasm at last.
&ldquo;It will be fine if Jamie, or &lsquo;Stub&rsquo; as we call him, is
along. When shall we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas is next week, Thursday, Betty,&rdquo; said her
mother. &ldquo;Suppose we start about Tuesday and come
home on Friday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just right!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;And stay at a fine hotel
and go to the shops&mdash;and the play? Oh, Mother, could
we go to the play?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think we&rsquo;ll go to a matin&eacute;e,&rdquo; said her mother.
&ldquo;Do you think Mrs. Graham would spare both her children
on Christmas day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty, a little doubtfully, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll ask her, and I know Agnes and Stub will be crazy to
go, so prob&rsquo;ly we can coax her into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wheedlesome Betty did &ldquo;coax Mrs. Graham into it,&rdquo;
though that lady was loath to be separated from her son
and daughter at the Christmas season. But the proposed
trip was so tempting that permission was finally given, and
the four young people were radiant with happiness at the
prospect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take Lisette,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, speaking
of her own maid, &ldquo;and if I get too tired to take
you children around to all the places you want to go to,
she can go with you; she is thoroughly reliable and
capable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So everything was arranged.</p>
<p>Tuesday proved to be a clear, cold day, and the party
started off in high spirits. Of course the Grahams were
Betty&rsquo;s guests for the whole trip.</p>
<p>Though Betty&rsquo;s large fortune, inherited from her paternal
grandfather, was all her own, her mother had been
appointed her guardian until she should come of age; and
while conscientious and prudent as to expenditures, she
also was determined that Betty should be allowed a goodly
number of the harmless pleasures that her large income
justified her having.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>So when the New York trip was decided upon, Mrs.
McGuire made every effort to give the children the most
enjoyable time possible.</p>
<p>And it was for this reason she proposed taking the two
Grahams as guests.</p>
<p>Lisette had been with her mistress a long time, and
was well versed in looking after the luggage and all such
details, so the party had nothing to do but enjoy every
moment. But, noticing a tendency on Jack&rsquo;s part to
make himself useful and attentive, Betty&rsquo;s mother
wisely encouraged it, knowing it was for the boy&rsquo;s own
good.</p>
<p>When they reached New York, the children, used to
the quiet village life of Greenborough, were fascinated and
almost bewildered by the noise and confusion. Jack had
never been in New York before, and Betty only once, but
the bustle and rush of the city appealed to them both,
and many kindly people smiled as they noted the shining
eyes and eager faces of the four friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A taxicab will not hold us all,&rdquo; said Betty&rsquo;s mother,
&ldquo;so, Lisette, you take the young ladies and Master James
in that one, and, Jack, will you kindly call that electric
hansom for you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Proud to be of service, Jack beckoned to the hansom
driver, and soon the two vehicles were whizzing away to
the Plaza Hotel, where rooms had been engaged for the
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if this isn&rsquo;t great!&rdquo; said Stub Graham, who,
though addressed by Lisette as &ldquo;Master James,&rdquo; was
&ldquo;Stub&rdquo; to the others. &ldquo;I say, Betty, you&rsquo;re the brickiest
sort of a brick to ask us to this splendiferous treat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty smiled happily. She was looking out at the hurrying
throngs of people, the tall buildings, the gay shop-windows,
and the jam of traffic, with unspeakable delight
in the novelty and excitement of the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think of three days of this gorgeousness!
Three whole days!&rdquo; said Agnes, squeezing Betty&rsquo;s arm in
her glee.</p>
<p>They soon reached the hotel and found Betty&rsquo;s mother
and Jack already there and waiting for them in the great
entrance-hall.</p>
<p>Betty was a little awed by the splendor all about her,
and Agnes and Stub were frankly delighted, and looked
around with undisguised interest.</p>
<p>But Jack, feeling a new responsibility as the escort of
Mrs. McGuire, had, quite unconsciously, acquired a manner
as of one accustomed to elaborate hotels and in no
way impressed by them. He seemed quite at home and
he paid no attention to the surroundings, but in a simple,
unaffected, but perfectly correct fashion, he stood by Betty&rsquo;s
mother, carrying her wrap gracefully over his arm,
and holding himself in readiness to obey her slightest
wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did Jack get that manner?&rdquo; thought Betty,
in amazement, and then she realized that he was acquiring
it merely by association with her mother, and through
a natural ability to adapt to himself her innate refinement
and gracious ways.</p>
<p>Betty was impulsive herself and now, though secretly
moved to mirth by Jack&rsquo;s quiet elegance of manner,
she resolved to try harder to improve her own demeanor.</p>
<p>They all went at once to the rooms reserved for them,
a beautiful apartment overlooking Central Park.</p>
<p>It was quite a little home of itself, as there was a comfortable
sitting-room, attractive dining-room, and four
bedrooms with dressing-rooms and baths.</p>
<p>A large room with two beds was allotted to Betty and
Agnes, and a similar one across the entrance-hall was
for the two boys. Lisette had a small room opening from
Mrs. McGuire&rsquo;s own which adjoined the girls&rsquo; room. In
a short time bags and trunks were unpacked and a few
individual belongings scattered about, and the apartment
seemed quite like a private home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do we have a dining-room?&rdquo; asked Betty.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we eat in the big restaurant down-stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, if you choose,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;But
I think our Christmas dinner is a personal sort of feast,
and I&rsquo;d like it better here by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; agreed Jack. &ldquo;Lots more fun, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll dine down-stairs to-night,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
McGuire; &ldquo;so skip away, girlies, and put on pretty frocks
for the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it larks!&rdquo; said Betty, as she and Agnes went
to their room to dress. &ldquo;Look at the beautiful Park!
To-morrow we&rsquo;ll take a ride in it. I wish we could go
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to-night,&rdquo; returned Agnes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather stay here in this beautiful hotel. There&rsquo;s so much
to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is. Hurry and dress. What are you going
to wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought my blue voile,&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;Mother
thought that would be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is; you look lovely in blue. I&rsquo;m wearing this
Dresden silk. They go nicely together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty expeditiously arranged herself in the pretty light
silk frock, and the girls hooked each other up and tied
each other&rsquo;s hair-ribbons, so that when Lisette came to
offer her services, they were quite unnecessary. The boys,
too, had made good time with their dressing and awaited
the girls in the sitting-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish we were going to dance!&rdquo; said Agnes.
&ldquo;But I suppose we couldn&rsquo;t in a hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can dance up here after dinner,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;Mother will play for us, I am sure; for see, there&rsquo;s a
piano here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though an adopted son, Mrs. McGuire had asked Jack
to call her &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; and the boy had been only too glad
to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play for you? Of course I will,&rdquo; said the lady herself,
entering the sitting-room. &ldquo;And now we will go
down to dinner. Lisette will stay here in charge of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack sprang to open the door.</p>
<p>He held it open till the last of his party went through
it, and then he closed it and followed them. Somehow he
was again in place to push the elevator bell, and Mrs. McGuire
looked at him with pride as she noticed his quiet
quickness and graceful ways.</p>
<p>Dinner was a delightful experience. Betty was a little
bewildered by the array of silver and glass, and Stub
frankly inquired which fork to use first, but Jack seemed
to know by intuition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to live in a place like this always,&rdquo; said Stub,
as he ate his ice-cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So wouldn&rsquo;t I,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;A hotel is all very well
for a few days, but it isn&rsquo;t a home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Agnes; &ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d get tired
of it if we had it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; returned Stub.
&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m a man, I&rsquo;m going to live in one. I don&rsquo;t
see many boys here, though,&rdquo; he added, looking
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, smiling; &ldquo;most boys prefer
a home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then dinner was over, and they all strolled through
the hotel corridor and bought some flowers at the flower-stand,
and some illustrated papers at the news-stand, and
then went up to their own apartment.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire played the piano for them, and they
danced a little, and then, after some planning for the next
day&rsquo;s entertainment, they all went to rest.</p>
<p>The next day was clear and pleasant, and when breakfast
was served in their own dining-room, all the party
were ready and eagerly awaiting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is decided,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, &ldquo;that we
have our Christmas tree this evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;Christmas eve is the time for
a tree, and to-morrow, on Christmas day, we&rsquo;ll have our
feast, our real Christmas dinner. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Agnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. And then the tree can stay here, can&rsquo;t
it, all day to-morrow? I love to look at a Christmas
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;And as I never had one before,
I&rsquo;ll keep this one as long as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was less than a year since Betty had inherited her
fortune, and before that she had been a poor little waif,
without money and without a home.</p>
<p>Her mother&rsquo;s heart thrilled with gladness to think that
Betty would have a tree this year, and she resolved to do
everything in her power to make it a beautiful one.</p>
<p>Very soon after breakfast they started on a shopping
expedition.</p>
<p>Two taxicabs were engaged, and the two girls, with
Lisette, occupied one, while Mrs. McGuire and the boys
rode in the other.</p>
<p>Such fun as they had shopping! They fairly tumbled
out of one shop into another. The tree had been ordered
from the hotel, but they bought ornaments and candles
and festoons of tinsel rope, and Mrs. McGuire bought some
other things secretly, as she wanted to have some surprises
for the young people. Then everybody bought presents
for everybody else. Betty found lovely things for the dear
ones who had remained at Denniston, and for the faithful
servants there, as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>She bought presents for her young friends in Greenborough,
too, and all these things they had expressed
directly home. But the fun was in buying presents for
each other. These, of course, must be kept very secret,
and Betty would urge Jack in a whisper to take Agnes
to another counter and keep her there, while Stub helped
Betty choose the present for his sister.</p>
<p>And so with the whole four. Each must be safely removed
from the scene of action while his or her gift was
purchased.</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s mother cautioned the young folks that all gifts
be simple and inexpensive.</p>
<p>So Agnes bought for Betty a pretty little white fan that
she might carry to evening parties, and Betty bought for
Agnes a slender gold bangle.</p>
<p>The boys bought knives for each other, which caused the
girls much amusement, for neither Jack nor Stub knew
that each had bought a knife, and the girls knew that the
knives were exactly alike. Of course Betty wished to give
more valuable gifts to Jack and her mother, so, under the
guidance of Mrs. McGuire, she bought a beautiful little
gold watch and fob for Jack. It was a beauty, and Betty
knew it would give the boy the keenest pleasure.</p>
<p>For her mother she wanted to get something very nice
indeed, but she had no one with whom to consult. Jack
and the Grahams were no better able than herself to advise
on such a subject, and Lisette could not be expected to
know much about it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>But, by a fortunate occurrence, the way was made easy.
Betty and her mother had gone to a great jewelry shop to
buy Jack&rsquo;s watch, and, after the purchase was completed,
they strolled about the shop looking at the beautiful things
displayed in the cases.</p>
<p>Suddenly Betty spied a lady whom she recognized. It
was Mrs. Sanderson, at whose house in New York Betty
had first met Grandma Kinsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Betty, speaking very quickly, &ldquo;will
you stay right here and not look around for a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you go away from me alone, Betty,&rdquo; said
her mother, smiling at the earnest little face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, I&rsquo;m only going to the very next counter,
and there&rsquo;s a lady that I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I trust you not to go farther than the next
counter; and I&rsquo;ll wait for you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but don&rsquo;t be too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty hurried to Mrs. Sanderson, who was looking at
jewels at the next counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Sanderson?&rdquo; she said, speaking
politely, but very rapidly. &ldquo;Do you remember me? I&rsquo;m
Betty McGuire, and I was at your house last year with
Mrs. Van Court, and I found Mrs. Kinsey there, and now
she lives with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanderson looked at the excited little girl, and at
last she remembered her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the little Irish girl who came
into a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me, ma&rsquo;am. And since
then I&rsquo;ve found my mother, and she&rsquo;s here with me. But
I want to buy her a Christmas present unbeknownst to
her, and I thought you&rsquo;d be willing to help me a bit if I
asked you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a strange child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanderson, putting
up her lorgnette to look at Betty again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am, ma&rsquo;am. But will you help me buy the
present, and then I&rsquo;ll introduce my mother; you&rsquo;ll love
her, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;s that sweet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Always when Betty was embarrassed or excited she
slipped back into her almost forgotten brogue. And perhaps
it was that and the persuasive little voice that
touched Mrs. Sanderson&rsquo;s sympathies, for she said kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly, my dear; I&rsquo;ll help you with pleasure.
What do you want to buy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a small diamond brooch, please, and not too
grand a one; my mother doesn&rsquo;t like things too grand.
But a plainish one that she could wear every day, and yet
a good one at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanderson smiled, but she seemed to understand,
and as the affable salesman showed them various styles,
she selected one that seemed to fit accurately Betty&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This, I think, is lovely,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your
mother would like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, too,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s the very one
I like best myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The purchase was completed, and, with the little
box in her hand, Betty took Mrs. Sanderson to the next
counter to meet her mother. The ladies seemed
too pleased to know each other, and Betty was very
happy.</p>
<p>Then good-by greetings were exchanged and, as it was
luncheon-hour, Betty&rsquo;s mother marshaled her brood together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we won&rsquo;t go back to the hotel for luncheon,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;for it&rsquo;s after one o&rsquo;clock, and we still have some
errands to do. So we&rsquo;ll go over to the Waldorf and lunch
there, which will give you hotel-loving children another
glimpse of a New York Christmas crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was carried out, and the young quartet watched
with sparkling eyes the throngs of people on Christmas
errands bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to finish our errands, and then home,&rdquo; said Mrs.
McGuire, after luncheon was over.</p>
<p>But when they reached the hotel again, about mid-afternoon,
Betty didn&rsquo;t want to go in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;the streets are so gay,
and the people are all going along with bundles and holly
wreaths, and it&rsquo;s all so Christmas-evey, can&rsquo;t we stay out
longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I want Lisette to help
me. But, if you wish, you four may go for a ride in the
Park or along the Avenue. But you must promise not
to get out of the cab. The chauffeur is entirely reliable,
and if you stay in the cab, you cannot get lost. Be back
here in one hour, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; chorused the four, so Mrs. McGuire and
Lisette went into the hotel, and the four delighted young
folk went for a further ride.</p>
<p>Their course down the Avenue was slow, owing to the
crowded traffic; they had ample opportunity for observing
the people, an amusement of which Betty never tired.
Then afterwards a short spin in the Park, where the lights
had already begun to gleam through the early winter
dusk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for home,&rdquo; said Jack decisively, when the hour
had elapsed; and back they went to their hotel.</p>
<p>But when they entered their own sitting-room, nobody
was there,&mdash;no tree, no presents, and no sign of any
human being.</p>
<p>Betty opened the door of her mother&rsquo;s bedroom, but
that, too, was unoccupied, as, indeed, were all the bedrooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Betty looked frightened, and said, in a half-whisper:
&ldquo;Oh, <i>do</i> you suppose anything has happened to Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Jack laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you guess? I&rsquo;ll wager
Mother and Lisette are in the dining-room, and they&rsquo;re
fixing the tree in there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the dining-room door was closed, and
when Betty flew to open it, she found it was locked as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us in, Mother; let us in!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my child,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, opening the
door a tiny crack and peeping out. &ldquo;You must all
amuse yourselves till dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, can&rsquo;t we help fix it?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ve plenty of help in here, and you must keep
out and not bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the door was shut and locked again, and the young
folks laughed to find themselves with occupation gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s get up a surprise for <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;just the thing! What&rsquo;ll
it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll have to think. Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell you, Jack; you
go down to the flower place, and get a lot of white carnations&mdash;just
heaps of &rsquo;em. And then get a lot of holly,
and bring &rsquo;em all up, and I&rsquo;ll show you. Oh, wait&mdash;get
the biggest holly wreath you can find, and a paper of
pins!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Obediently Jack went off, and as the big hotel was able
to supply such demands, he brought back everything Betty
asked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much,&rdquo; said Betty, as she tied a big towel
over her pretty frock for an apron. &ldquo;Come in my room,
all of you, so she won&rsquo;t see it if she comes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three followed Betty, and she disclosed her
plan. First she filled the center of the big wreath with
white carnations, having first crisscrossed it closely with
string, to keep the blossoms in place. Then she set the
others to work picking off the red berries from the bunch
of holly Jack had brought, sticking a pin through each.
With these prepared berries Betty formed letters on the
white background, and as she deftly did her task they
saw the words grow under her fingers, &ldquo;Merry Christmas
to Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; cried Stub. &ldquo;Betty, you&rsquo;re a real genius!
I declare it&rsquo;s the prettiest wreath I ever saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It <i>was</i> pretty, for the holly wreath framed the loving
greeting spelled out on the white carnations, and Betty&rsquo;s
true eye had spaced the letters admirably.</p>
<p>It was not quite finished when Mrs. McGuire emerged
from the dining-room. But Betty hastily stuck in the
remaining pins with their red berry heads, and Jack asked
Mrs. McGuire not to peep into Betty&rsquo;s room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only time to
dress for dinner, and you young people had better scamper
if you want to have any evening left for your tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scamper they did, and soon a very hungry but jolly
party made its way down to the dining-room.</p>
<p>The girls were in festival dress because it was Christmas
eve. Their white frocks of filmy mousseline were
cut out a little at the throat, and red sashes and hair-ribbons
gave an air of Christmas to their costumes. Each
wore a holly spray in her hair, and Jack declared himself
proud of the visions of loveliness that graced his party.</p>
<p>But notwithstanding the jolly time they were having,
and the excitement of it all, there was no lingering after
dinner.</p>
<p>Though the girls would have liked to stay down-stairs
and listen to the music and watch the people, yet the tree
seemed to call loudly to them even through the closed
door. So up they went, Betty&rsquo;s little face fairly aglow
with the happiness of her first real Christmas. She held
her mother&rsquo;s hand tightly as, at last, Lisette threw open
the door of the dining-room, and they all went in.</p>
<p>The tree was a marvel. Stalwart porters of the hotel
had set it in place, and had assisted Mrs. McGuire to decorate
it. It shimmered and glittered with tinsel ropes;
it sparkled with shining ornaments; it trembled with
tiny lighted candles, and it fairly blazed with hundreds
of tiny electric lights of all colors. This was one of Mrs.
McGuire&rsquo;s surprises. Even the Grahams had never seen
a Christmas tree electrically lighted, and as for Stub&mdash;he
fairly whistled in ecstasy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>what</i> a corker!&rdquo; he exclaimed, for more grammatical
language seemed inadequate.</p>
<p>Betty drew closer to her mother&rsquo;s side and slipped her
arm around her waist, as she stood speechless before the
beautiful tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her eyes as bright as the
electrics themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her mother, bending to kiss the top of her
child&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;And for Jack,&rdquo; she added, holding out
her other hand to the boy, who came, a bit shyly, to her
embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for all of us,&rdquo; shouted Stub gaily; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
leave us out, Mrs. McGuire, and though my small sister
seems for the moment to be speechless, yet I can assure
you she thinks it&rsquo;s a very nice tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Very nice tree!</i>&rdquo; cried Agnes; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the gorgeousest,
wonderfulest tree that ever was on the face of the earth!
I know it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had admired it over and over, Mrs. McGuire
proposed that they take off the gifts, assuring them that
such a proceeding would not mar the effect of the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>So the ever polite and ready Jack, aided by Stub when
the gifts were flung high, took down the presents one by
one, and delivered them to those whose names were written
on them.</p>
<p>Somehow there seemed to be lots of gifts. For five people,
each giving to every one else, made a good many, and
then there were a lot of extra ones that just seemed to
come from Santa Claus himself.</p>
<p>Of course Lisette was not forgotten, and she stood in
the background, delighted beyond words to see Betty&rsquo;s
pleasure in her beautiful Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire&rsquo;s present to her daughter was a gold locket
containing a miniature of her own lovely face. It hung
from a slender gold chain, and no gift could have pleased
Betty more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always wear it,&rdquo; she said, as her mother clasped
it round her throat; &ldquo;and, Mother, you must always wear
my gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother was greatly surprised at the diamond
brooch, and wondered how Betty had sufficient taste and
judgment to select such a beauty. So Betty told how Mrs.
Sanderson had helped her, and all admired the lovely
jewel when it was pinned at the top of its owner&rsquo;s delicate
lace bodice.</p>
<p>The tables were filled with the various trinkets and
knickknacks, and the floor was strewn with tissue-papers
and narrow red ribbons. Then Jack and Stub brought
in the big Christmas greeting Betty and the others had
made, and her mother was delighted at the pretty attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>It was late indeed when they sought their beds, for a
refection of ices and cakes had to be attended to, and some
Christmas carols sung, and a Christmas dance indulged
in. But at last all the lights were out, and the stars
twinkled down on one of the happiest girls in the great
city, a girl who was restfully sleeping after the joys of
her first real Christmas.</p>

<br />BETTY AT BOARDING-SCHOOL</h2>
<p>It was New Year&rsquo;s eve, and Betty, with her mother and
Jack, was spending a few days at the Irvings&rsquo; in Boston.
Betty was a great favorite with her grandfather, and
the two spent delightful hours together as the old gentleman
showed Betty the many places of interest in the city.</p>
<p>Mr. Irving was of somewhat eccentric nature, and he
declared that he much preferred Betty&rsquo;s frank and sometimes
blunt straightforwardness to what he called the &ldquo;airs
and graces&rdquo; of more fashionably trained young girls.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Irving did not share her husband&rsquo;s views.
She thought Betty decidedly lacking in many details of
correct deportment, and she urged Mrs. McGuire to send
Betty to a boarding-school for a year or two, that she
might be properly trained to take her place in society later,
with the demeanor becoming a well-bred young lady and
an heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Betty isn&rsquo;t a young lady yet,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire,
looking troubled when these arguments were laid before
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, perhaps,&rdquo; returned her mother. &ldquo;But
she will live in a city ere long, and, as our descendant,
should be made familiar with the finer points of correct
behavior. Jack seems to pick up such things immediately,
but Betty, though a dear child, is crude in her manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small wonder,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, thinking of the
lack of advantages in Betty&rsquo;s early life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough; and that&rsquo;s all the more reason why she
should be placed in an atmosphere of correct deportment
at once. She will learn much more by association with
cultured young girls of her own age than by your individual
tuition. You spoil her by letting her have her own
way entirely too much, and you are blind to her faults.
You know perfectly well, my dear, I have only Betty&rsquo;s
good at heart in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire did know this, and yet she could not bear
the idea of separation from her daughter, with whom she
had been so lately reunited.</p>
<p>On New Year&rsquo;s eve the Irvings had made a party for
Betty. They had invited young people from some of the
best families they knew, and both Betty and Jack were
greatly pleased when they learned of it.</p>
<p>It was a very citified party, and quite unlike the merry
gatherings of Greenborough children. The hours were
from seven to ten, and the first part of the evening the
guests sat round the rooms, in small gilt chairs that had
been brought in for the occasion, and listened to the songs
and stories of a professional entertainer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>It was a charming young woman who told the stories
and sang the songs, and after each number the children
clapped their hands sedately and waited for the next.</p>
<p>Secretly Betty thought it rather tame, and would have
preferred a rollicking game or a merry dance. But she
applauded with the others and tried to appear politely
pleased.</p>
<p>After the program all marched decorously to the dining-room,
where a pleasant little supper was served. Then
the guests took leave, each making a correct courtesy to
the hostess, and expressing their pleasure as if by rote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that wasn&rsquo;t the <i>stiffest</i> party!&rdquo; said Betty
to her mother, when they were alone later. &ldquo;Those children
were just like wooden images.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire looked troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t see these things quite
rightly. Your grandmother thinks those children act correctly,
and that you don&rsquo;t. But, you see, city life is quite
different from that of a small village. How would you
like to move to live in a big city, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And give up Denniston? My beautiful home! Oh,
Mother, I don&rsquo;t want to do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want you to. Well, we&rsquo;ll see what can
be done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; resulted in long talks by the elders of the
family, and these talks resulted in a decision to send Betty
at once to a boarding-school at Hillside Manor, a fine
country place about a hundred miles away.</p>
<p>As the winter term was just beginning, she was to go
directly, without returning to Greenborough.</p>
<p>The school was most highly recommended, and Mrs.
McGuire was persuaded that it would give Betty the
&ldquo;finish&rdquo; she needed.</p>
<p>But the plan did not please Betty at all. She did not
rebel,&mdash;that was not her way,&mdash;but she expressed her
feelings in the matter so clearly that there was no doubt
as to her state of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go, Mother,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I hate to be
with a lot of girls&mdash;I want my own family and my <i>home</i>.
Oh, Mother, must I leave my home when I love it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Betty darling,&rdquo; said her mother, though strongly
tempted to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;; &ldquo;I see it is for your good to send
you away, and I&rsquo;m sure you ought to go. But I shall miss
you dreadfully, and just count the days till your return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard lines, Betty,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;but as long as
they all think you ought to go, I should think you&rsquo;d be
glad to go and learn the right sort of thing, whatever it is.
Old Tutor Nixon is wise and all that, but he can&rsquo;t fill the
bill in other ways. At least that&rsquo;s what Grandma Irving
thinks, and so do I, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, there was no one who agreed with Betty&rsquo;s ideas
except her grandfather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All bosh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My granddaughter is a natural,
unaffected, unspoiled girl. You send her off to Madam
Tippetywitch, or whoever she is, and she&rsquo;ll come back an
artificial young miss, with no thought but for fashions and
foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old gentleman was entirely overruled by the
determination of his wife, and Betty was sent away.</p>
<p>None of the family accompanied Betty to the school, as
Mrs. Irving felt sure the child would be less homesick
if she started off with a gay party of girls who were going
back to their classes.</p>
<p>And so good-bys were said at the station in Boston,
and Betty made the trip to Hillside in company with half
a dozen school-girls, in charge of one of the teachers.
It was a strange position in which Betty found herself.
An heiress in her own right, she yet felt a sense of inferiority
which she herself could not explain.</p>
<p>Her Irish ancestry revealed itself in her warm-hearted
willingness to be friends with the girls, and her inherited
New England nature made her reserved and sensitive to
either real or apparent slights from them. The girls, notwithstanding
their inborn good breeding and their past
seasons at Hillside Manor, looked at Betty with ill-concealed
curiosity. They knew she was an heiress, and that
very fact made them hold aloof from her, lest they be suspected
of a spirit of toadying to wealth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>But Betty did not appreciate this point, and assumed
that the girls were not very cordial because they considered
themselves her superiors. Each one spoke to her, politely
enough, but in constrained, perfunctory fashion, and then,
feeling their duty done, they resumed their own chatter
about matters unknown to Betty. Miss Price, the teacher,
was a pleasant-faced lady, but, after a few courteous words,
she became absorbed in a book, looking up only now and
then to glance at her young charges. After a time Betty&rsquo;s
spirit of independence became aroused. She wondered
if she were excluded from the girls&rsquo; sociability because she
herself was lacking in cordiality. Smiling pleasantly, she
said to Ada Porter, who sat next to her: &ldquo;Are you in my
classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, really,&rdquo; said Ada, not unkindly, but
entirely uninterested. &ldquo;What classes are you in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling at the absurdity of
the conversation.</p>
<p>But Ada didn&rsquo;t seem to think it humorous, and merely
stared at Betty, as she said, &ldquo;How queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty colored. She felt awkward and tongue-tied, and
yet, the more she realized her inability to impress these
girls pleasantly, the more she determined to do so.</p>
<p>Then Betty bethought herself of a box of fine candies in
her satchel, and taking it out, she passed it around to the
other girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Murmuring conventional thanks, each accepted one
bonbon, but declined a second one, and then Betty found
herself with her box in her lap, gazing out of the window,
as much alone as if there had been no one in the car.</p>
<p>But at last the three hours&rsquo; ride was over, and Betty&rsquo;s
hopeful nature looked forward to finding some among the
pupils who would be more friendly than her traveling
associates.</p>
<p>Omnibuses from the school met them at the station,
and by chance Betty was put in with a dozen girls none
of whom had been with her in the car.</p>
<p>But conditions were no better than before. They nodded
diffidently to Betty, and then began to chatter to each
other with the gay freedom of old acquaintances.</p>
<p>One girl, however, who sat opposite Betty, was also a
new pupil. She had coal-black hair and bright black
eyes, that darted quickly about, seeming to take in everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re new, too, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said at last, leaning
over to seize Betty&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Betty, grateful for the word spoken
voluntarily to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. I think the other girls are hateful to ignore
us so. But don&rsquo;t you mind; we&rsquo;ll show them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Though this was independence of spirit, Betty couldn&rsquo;t
quite approve of the way it was expressed, nor of
the belligerent wag of the head with which it was emphasized.</p>
<p>But the girl&rsquo;s attitude was friendly toward her, if rather
hostile toward the others, and lonely little Betty yearned
for friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, they all know each other,&rdquo; she said,
smiling at the black-eyed one; &ldquo;that makes such a difference,
and they&rsquo;ve so much to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; let us know each other, then. My name&rsquo;s
Madeleine Gorman; what&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty McGuire,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling into the friendly
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty! My, you are new! You must call yourself
Elizabeth up here. Nicknames don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d just as lief be called Elizabeth; I don&rsquo;t mind.
But I&rsquo;m Betty at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m Maddy at home, and Mad, and Mother calls
me Lina. But I&rsquo;m sure Madeleine&rsquo;s the ticket in a fashionable
boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not here. But to three other grand schools.
Mother&rsquo;s always changing about when she hears of a more
&lsquo;select&rsquo; one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Betty was a bit bewildered. Surely the ambitions of
Madeleine&rsquo;s mother were in line with those of Mrs. Irving,
and yet Betty couldn&rsquo;t imagine her grandmother talking
like that! She felt sure the Irvings <i>were</i> &ldquo;select,&rdquo; but
she felt equally sure they would never proclaim it in words.</p>
<p>She gave up the problem as too difficult, but, greatly
cheered by Madeleine&rsquo;s cordiality, she met her friendly
advances half-way, and when they reached the school they
felt really well acquainted. Together they went to the
principal.</p>
<p>Miss Frelinghuysen was an imposing-looking lady with
sharp features and sharp eyes. She welcomed them with
effusion, called each &ldquo;my dear child,&rdquo; and expressed
hope that each would be happy and contented at the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we room together, Elizabeth and I?&rdquo; Madeleine
asked.</p>
<p>Miss Frelinghuysen appeared to hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish it, my dear?&rdquo; she asked of Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Betty, hastily, concluding that a girl
she knew to be friendly was preferable to any utter
stranger; &ldquo;yes, I should like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then you may, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a trump,&rdquo; said Madeleine, squeezing Betty&rsquo;s
arm as they went away; &ldquo;I was so afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t
room with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. You might feel too grand. You&rsquo;ve
just come into a lot of money, they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to young girls,&rdquo;
said Betty, simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Madeleine, at which Betty
laughed outright. She felt sure it couldn&rsquo;t be true.</p>
<p>Hillside Manor was a large and rather magnificent
house, yet when Betty and Madeleine reached their room,
they found it small and cramped. There was only one
window, and though the two beds were narrow, they left
but little space to move about. There was only one wash-stand,
and, accustomed of late to having nice things about
her, Betty looked around in dismay.</p>
<p>It was not that she so much minded not having elaborate
furnishings, but such close quarters to be shared
with another made her feel hampered, and she thought
longingly of her lovely big room at Denniston, with the
dainty fittings all her own.</p>
<p>And yet she knew she would not like to room alone
at the school. That was an awful loneliness to look
forward to.</p>
<p>So she began unpacking her things to dress for dinner.
Madeleine chattered all the time, seeming not to care
whether Betty answered or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have the top drawer of the dresser, and
I&rsquo;ll take the next,&rdquo; said Madeleine, good-naturedly; &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll divide the hooks in the wardrobe evenly. Which
bed do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;take your choice first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll take this one,&rdquo; and Madeleine flung
two large hats on the bed she selected.</p>
<p>But as she immediately afterward piled a lot of her
things on the other bed, it seemed to make little difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind those clothes,&rdquo; she said apologetically.
&ldquo;Pile your own right on top of &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em put
away somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no time then, as they must dress for
dinner, and the gong would sound shortly.</p>
<p>Madeleine greatly admired Betty&rsquo;s pretty rose-colored
voile trimmed with delicate lace, and she was loud in her
praise of Betty&rsquo;s simple bits of jewelry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a lovely locket!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Let me wear
it to-night, won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;d love to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty hesitated; she disliked to refuse her friend&rsquo;s first
request, but she couldn&rsquo;t let any one else wear her locket,
with her mother&rsquo;s picture in it, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to wear that myself,&rdquo; she said frankly; &ldquo;I
always wear it afternoons. But you may wear my bangle
instead, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d love to,&rdquo; and Madeleine slipped the pretty
gold bangle on her wrist. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you lend me a hair-ribbon,
Elizabeth, too? I see you&rsquo;ve plenty of them, and
mine are so old.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Betty, willingly offering her box of
new ribbons. Madeleine selected a pair of wide red ones,
and gaily tied them on her black curls. As it happened,
these were Betty&rsquo;s favorite ribbons, and she had no other
red ones, but she was wearing white ones herself, and she
said nothing.</p>
<p>Madeleine helped herself to Betty&rsquo;s cologne-water, and
made free with several of her toilet appurtenances, and
at last, after saying, &ldquo;Oh, my dear, please lend me a
handkerchief; mine are full of holes!&rdquo; they went down-stairs.</p>
<p>Dinner was an awful ordeal. The girls sat at long
tables, each headed by a teacher, and were expected to
converse on light topics. Betty rather envied the ease
with which most of them uttered trivial commonplaces,
but she couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that their accents and shrill
little notes of laughter were artificial. Without even formulating
her own thoughts, she felt that the girls were
all self-conscious and critical of one another, and she
conceived a sudden and violent antipathy to the whole atmosphere
of the school that she knew she could never
conquer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Entirely unconscious of herself, Betty did not realize
that she was not taking any part in the &ldquo;light&rdquo; conversation,
and it was a shock when Miss Price said, in a somewhat
mincing tone: &ldquo;We want you to join in our chat,
Miss McGuire. Suppose you tell us how you spent your
Christmas day.&rdquo; Straightforwardly Betty said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We spent our Christmas day in New York, at the
Plaza Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had she said this than she saw, by
the expressions on the girls&rsquo; faces, she had made a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How interesting!&rdquo; said Miss Price; but it suddenly
flashed on Betty that they all thought her remark ostentatious,
and that it was, in some way, inexcusable to spend
Christmas day away from one&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t help looking distressed, for there was
not a trace of ostentation in her whole nature, and her
enjoyment of her wealth was merely in the simple pleasures
that it brought her, without thought of vanity or
pride in the possession of it.</p>
<p>Never before had she been accused of this, nor was she
now, in words, but there was no doubting the meaning of
the looks directed at her.</p>
<p>Miss Price tactfully changed the subject, but Betty
made no more contributions to the &ldquo;light&rdquo; conversation
of that dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The hour in the drawing-room that followed was worse
still. Had Betty only known it, her experience was not
so very different from that of any new pupil at a strange
school; for of course those who have known each other in
previous terms naturally get together to talk over their
vacation, and new-comers are left to be taken into favor
later, if they qualify for it.</p>
<p>But Betty didn&rsquo;t know this, and she felt it a personal
slight that nobody talked to her and nobody seemed responsive
if she opened a conversation.</p>
<p>Madeleine stayed by her side, but the more Betty talked
with her, the more she was convinced she didn&rsquo;t like her.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s most ungrateful of me,&rdquo; thought poor Betty
to herself, &ldquo;for she&rsquo;s the only one who has shown me
decent friendliness, so she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last it was bedtime, and the girls filed out of the
room, saying good night to Miss Frelinghuysen as they
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your hand a little higher,&rdquo; she said to Betty,
&ldquo;and your head just a trifle to one side,&mdash;so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty imitated the model, alas, only too well! So anxious
was she to do as she was told, that her attitude was
an exaggeration of the principal&rsquo;s; indeed, it seemed
a mockery, though nothing was farther from Betty&rsquo;s
intention.</p>
<p>The girls behind her giggled outright, which didn&rsquo;t
speak very well for their innate good breeding.</p>
<p>Miss Frelinghuysen turned scarlet, and said: &ldquo;Report
to me in my study to-morrow morning at ten, Miss McGuire.
Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Betty, all unaware of what she
had done wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Elizabeth, you were killing!&rdquo; declared Madeleine,
when they reached their room. &ldquo;But how dared
you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went off in peals of subdued laughter, only pausing
at Betty&rsquo;s amazed, &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the way you mimicked the principal! It was
great! You looked <i>so</i> ridiculous, and that made her seem
silly. Oh, it was too good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I didn&rsquo;t mean to do any such thing!&rdquo; said
Betty, ready to cry at the idea of having added a misdemeanor
to her other troubles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you did! And she&rsquo;ll never believe you didn&rsquo;t
mean to. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it myself if you didn&rsquo;t
look so scared to death. Oh, you&rsquo;ll catch it to-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miserable indeed now, Betty began to prepare for bed.
She could scarcely find room for her things, for Madeleine
had appropriated far more than half of the cupboards
and pegs; and the table and two chairs were strewn
with her not very orderly wardrobe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Elizabeth,&rdquo; she said, suddenly coming toward
Betty as they were almost ready to put out the light,
&ldquo;I want to ask you something. I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t mind,
for of course it&rsquo;s nothing to you, but will you lend me
a little money? Just till my allowance comes, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Betty, who, never having heard such
a request before, supposed it was polite to grant it.
&ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by such prompt compliance, Madeleine
doubled the amount she had meant to ask for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you&mdash;could you make it twenty dollars?&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but what is there to spend money for here?
I didn&rsquo;t bring so very much with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I want to join a society to-morrow; I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most
sure I can get in, but you have to pay dues in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty gave Madeleine the money without further remark,
and the two girls went to bed.</p>
<p>But Betty could not sleep. She lay there in the dark,
wondering how she could live in this awful school. Madeleine&rsquo;s
mention of a society alarmed her. She would be
glad to join a society if the girls would be nice to her;
but to join one and have the members cool and unpleasant
toward her would be awful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>And already she disliked Madeleine. Not because she
had borrowed money, though somehow Betty felt that
was not a right thing for a young girl to do, but because
she was so careless with her things and so pushing and
forward in her intimacy with Betty. Betty laughed to
herself at this thought! Madeleine was <i>too</i> friendly, and
the other girls were not friendly enough. Well, that was
true. And Betty had looked at their faces carefully that
evening. Not one had given her a glance of simple,
kindly, girlish friendship. They had looked at her curiously,
inquisitively, and even enviously, but for some
reason she knew they didn&rsquo;t like her.</p>
<p>Poor little Betty knew nothing of class distinction, and
little dreamed that her warm-hearted, generous nature
could easily conquer these difficulties in a short time.
She fell at last into a troubled sleep, only to awaken long
before dawn, with a heavy heart and a feeling of despair.</p>
<p>She lay in her narrow bed, thinking over the experiences
of the day before, and looking forward to the interview
with the principal to which she was summoned at
ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>And as she thought of that, her spirit revolted. She
had not mimicked the lady&rsquo;s manner. She had simply
tried to do as she was told, and she would not be punished
for it!</p>
<p>A great resolve came to her, so great that she could
scarcely formulate it to herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>But, prompted by her indomitable Irish will-power, and
urged on by her outraged sense of justice, she rose slowly
from her bed, and, moving softly about the room, began
to dress herself. The first touches of dawn gave her just
light enough to distinguish the larger objects in the
room, and by the time she was fully dressed she could
see almost clearly. She had put on the traveling-suit
she had worn from Boston, and carried her small satchel,
leaving her trunk partly unpacked.</p>
<p>She could send for her clothes afterward, or she did not
care if she never saw them again. What was the use of
a fortune if it didn&rsquo;t enable one to run away from a terrible
place without worrying about one&rsquo;s clothes?</p>
<p>She glanced at sleeping Madeleine, and then, on an
impulse, she wrote a hurried note, which she pinned to her
own pillow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Madeleine</span>: I did not mimic the lady, and I do not wish
to be punished for what I didn&rsquo;t do. Also, I do not like the school,
and I am going home.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Elizabeth McGuire.</span></span></p>
<p>P. S. You may keep my bangle to remember me by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the sight of the bangle still on Madeleine&rsquo;s wrist
that prompted this postscript, and then, taking her satchel,
Betty softly opened the door and closed it behind her.</p>
<p>The hall was almost dark, and Betty had no notion how
she was to get out of the house, but at least she meant to
try in every possible way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The large front door was so firmly fastened with chains
and heavy bolts that she didn&rsquo;t even attempt to open
that, but she remembered the great window in the drawing-room.
She easily unfastened one of those long French
windows opening on the veranda, and in a moment was
walking rapidly down the drive. It was a long walk to
the railroad station, but the way was unmistakable, and
Betty trudged on, her heart growing lighter at every
step.</p>
<p>The sun was shining brightly when she reached the
station, and the ticket-agent told her a train for Boston
would stop there at a quarter before eight. It was nearly
that then, and Betty bought her ticket, and hoped fervently
she could get away before any one from the
school should follow her. Not that she intended to return
with them if they did. She had no thought of running
away; she knew only that she could not live at Hillside
Manor, so she had left it.</p>
<p>The ticket-agent scanned her curiously, but Betty looked
perfectly unconcerned, and he saw no occasion to question
her.</p>
<p>About eleven o&rsquo;clock she reached Boston. On the journey
she had been thinking over the situation, and, though
she had no fear of her mother&rsquo;s displeasure at her return,
she knew her Grandmother Irving would be extremely
annoyed.</p>
<p>Not so, though, her grandfather.</p>
<p>And, with true Irish ingenuity, Betty concluded to go
straight to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic5">
<img src="images/i082.jpg" alt="&ldquo;WHY, GRANDFATHER, I&mdash;I RAN AWAY!&rdquo;" width="500" height="711" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;WHY, GRANDFATHER, I&mdash;I <i>RAN AWAY</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>She took a cab at the Boston station, and her calm
dignity seemed to forbid any surprise on the part of the
cabman, and she gave the address of Mr. Irving&rsquo;s business
office.</p>
<p>Paying the cabman and dismissing him, she went
straight to her grandfather&rsquo;s private room and walked
in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come home, Grandfather,&rdquo; she announced
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul! Betty, is that you? What are <i>you</i>
doing here? Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; and Betty&rsquo;s spirits rose at the sight of
the dear, familiar face. She threw her arms around his
neck, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandfather, <i>you&rsquo;ll</i> help me out, won&rsquo;t you? I
<i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> stay there! Their manners are <i>awful</i>! And
they thought I mocked at the lady, but I didn&rsquo;t. And I
know Grandmother won&rsquo;t like my coming home, but I just
<i>had</i> to! So you fix it up with her, won&rsquo;t you? And what
do you think? I haven&rsquo;t had a scrap of breakfast, and I
just couldn&rsquo;t eat my dinner last night, so I&rsquo;m fearfully
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Irving again. &ldquo;Why,
you poor child! Wouldn&rsquo;t they give you any breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t understand! I came away before anybody
was up. I took the 7.45 from Hillside station, and,
you see, coming off suddenly as I did, I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t stop
for breakfast. Why, Grandfather, I&mdash;I <i>ran away</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little rascal! I haven&rsquo;t the heart to blame you.
But, as you suspect, your grandmother won&rsquo;t be glad!
Betty, you&rsquo;re a caution! Did you have any money with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but a girl borrowed twenty dollars last night, so
I didn&rsquo;t have much to spare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving shook with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty, to think of a young lady at a finishing-school
borrowing from a little unfledged pigeon like you!
Well, that ought to trouble your grandmother! But
come on, you blessed baby; let&rsquo;s go and get some breakfast
at the nearest restaurant, and then go home to break
the news to your relatives! Yes, Betty, your old grandfather&rsquo;ll
stand by you for a plucky little martyr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; said Betty, tucking her little
hand in his arm, as they started out together.</p>

<br />AN ACCEPTABLE VALENTINE</h2>
<p>The McGuires had lived for more than a month in
their pleasant home on Commonwealth Avenue, and
Betty had begun to feel at home there.</p>
<p>The house was only rented for the winter, and Denniston
Hall was temporarily closed until the summer-time,
when they expected to go back there. The whole arrangement
had been made in order that Betty might attend
school in Boston, and she was a day-pupil in Miss Whittier&rsquo;s
school for girls, which was quite near her home.</p>
<p>The school was very much to Betty&rsquo;s liking. She had
started in under very pleasant auspices, as she had become
acquainted with two or three of the girls before she went.
She soon made friends with the others, and, as school
hours lasted only from nine o&rsquo;clock till one, she had the
advantage of being most of the time in her own home.</p>
<p>The house, completely furnished, had been rented from
some friends of Mrs. McGuire&rsquo;s who were traveling
abroad, but Betty had had some of her favorite belongings
sent up from Denniston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Good-natured Pete had taken Betty&rsquo;s list and had carefully
packed and forwarded every item on it, and then,
after securely locking up the house, had followed the
family to Boston, and was installed there as general
utility-man, and a very valuable one at that.</p>
<p>Grandma Jean and little Polly were also there, and
Jack, who had entered the Institute of Technology, was
delighted with his new opportunities for progress in his
studies.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire had wisely concluded not to make very
desperate efforts to improve Betty&rsquo;s &ldquo;manners,&rdquo; but to
trust to the general influences of a well-ordered school and
well-bred companions.</p>
<p>And so Betty was happy in her new school life, and
was rapidly making firm friends among the pupils there.</p>
<p>Indeed, given a fair start, she could not fail to be a
general favorite, for her warm-hearted unselfishness and
her cheerful good nature were unfailing, and she was
always ready to do a favor or to enter into a plan with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Though friendly with the others, Betty liked Jeanette
Porter and Dorothy Bates best of all the girls, and this
trio were often together, both in and out of school hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Jeanette was a slender, rather delicate, girl, with a
sweet countenance and large, serious eyes. Dorothy was
a gay, roly-poly sort of a being, who was always smiling,
and irrepressibly inclined to mischief. But they both
loved Betty, and she was fond of them, and never a cross
word marred the happiness of their intimacy. Sometimes,
if Jeanette seemed too sober-faced, the other two would
tease her a bit or play a merry joke on her, but always in
a spirit of harmless fun, and when their victim could no
longer keep from smiling at their foolery, they declared
themselves satisfied.</p>
<p>But one day, as they walked home from school together,
Jeanette was really troubled about something, and though
she tried to conceal it, she was on the very verge of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jeanie?&rdquo; said Betty, tucking
her arm through her friend&rsquo;s, while Dorothy walked on
her other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Betty,&rdquo; said Jeanette, not crossly, but decidedly.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t ask me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we will ask you about it!&rdquo; declared Dorothy.
&ldquo;You just must tell us what&rsquo;s up, because we&rsquo;re your
trusties and trues&mdash;aren&rsquo;t we, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we are! What&rsquo;s up, Jeanette? Anybody
been scolding you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t that. Oh, girls, I don&rsquo;t want to tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy. &ldquo;Now, you
just out with it, Miss Secret-Keeper, and pretty quick,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it&rsquo;s nothing, anyhow,&rdquo; said Jeanette, with
a heightened color; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only that I can&rsquo;t go to the reception.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not go to the reception!&rdquo; cried Betty and Dorothy
together. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because&mdash;because I can&rsquo;t have a new dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ll give you a
new dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Betty&rsquo;s amazement, Jeanette turned to her with a
look she never forgot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How <i>dare</i> you say such a thing, Betty McGuire? If
you weren&rsquo;t one of my best friends, I&rsquo;d never forgive
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean any harm,&rdquo; stammered Betty, quite
crushed by Jeanette&rsquo;s offended look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; chimed in Dorothy; &ldquo;in fact,
she didn&rsquo;t mean it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty was about to speak, but Dorothy pinched her
arm to be silent, and went on herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need a new dress, Jeanette. Your white
muslin with the lace yoke is a very pretty dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was; but it&rsquo;s just been done up, and it went all to
pieces. It&rsquo;s so old, you know. Mother said she didn&rsquo;t
believe it would stand washing again. So I can&rsquo;t go, and
I told Miss Whittier to-day that I wouldn&rsquo;t select a piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a shame!&rdquo; cried Betty; &ldquo;and you recite
so well, too. Can&rsquo;t you wear some other dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have nothing fit for an evening affair, and
Mother says I can&rsquo;t have a new one. So I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>At Miss Whittier&rsquo;s school a reception was given each
winter, and always a very important event. The parents
and friends of the pupils were invited, and elaborate preparations
were made for the occasion. The girls wore
their prettiest frocks, and a program of entertainment was
given in which the pupils who excelled in singing or
declamation took part.</p>
<p>Usually this reception was held on the date of some
poet&rsquo;s birthday, and this year the 27th of February, Longfellow&rsquo;s
birthday, had been chosen.</p>
<p>It was now the 10th, but the intervening time was
none too long in which to prepare for the great event.</p>
<p>Betty, Jeanette, and Dorothy were all among the ones
chosen to recite from the poet&rsquo;s works, and a prize would
be rewarded to the one who best deserved it.</p>
<p>Each contestant was allowed to make her own selection,
and already Betty was practising on &ldquo;The Wreck
of the <i>Hesperus</i>,&rdquo; while Dorothy had chosen &ldquo;The Skeleton
in Armor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These decisions were profound secrets among the school-girls,
only Miss Whittier being supposed to know what
each girl was to recite. But of course our three little
friends told each other in the strictest confidence, and
when Jeanette announced her intention of staying away
from the reception, both Betty and Dorothy were
astounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>But argumenting and coaxing were in vain, and when
Jeanette turned in at her own gate, the other two said
good-by and went on toward their homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever made Jeanette so angry when I offered to
give her a dress?&rdquo; exclaimed Betty as soon as she and
Dorothy were alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you goose, of course she wouldn&rsquo;t accept a
dress from anybody! You ought to have known that the
mere mention of such a thing would offend her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see why. I&rsquo;d love to give it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would hurt her pride too much. Don&rsquo;t you see,
the Porters are not at all well off,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean quite
poor, but I mean they have to scrimp to get along,&mdash;but
they&rsquo;re fearfully proud. Jeanette would be quite willing
to say she couldn&rsquo;t afford a new frock, but she&rsquo;d die before
she&rsquo;d let any one give her one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think that&rsquo;s silly. Just because I happen to
have more money than she has, is the very reason I ought
to give her a dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem so,&rdquo; admitted Dorothy, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t so,
and don&rsquo;t you ever propose it to her again, for it won&rsquo;t be
a bit of good, and it only makes her angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t, then, but won&rsquo;t it be horrid not to have
Jeanette at the reception? It takes all the fun out of it
for us, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so, too; and look here, Betty, don&rsquo;t you
tell anybody the reason why Jeanette&rsquo;s not coming.
She told us, of course, but she knew we wouldn&rsquo;t
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she tell Miss Whittier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, silly. Though most likely Miss Whittier
guessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said Jeanette would just as lief tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she might tell it to us, not to any one else. I
declare, Betty, you don&rsquo;t seem to have any gumption
about some things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty, rather meekly, for she was often
bothered by her lack of &ldquo;gumption&rdquo; about matters which
were new to her experience.</p>
<p>On reaching her own home, she went straight to her
mother with the story.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire sat reading in the pleasant library, and
looked up with a loving smile as Betty entered rather
abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you tell me, Mother,&rdquo; she concluded, after
she had poured out her indignation, &ldquo;why Jeanette should
get so angry at what I said?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t understand, deary,&rdquo; said her mother,
smoothing Betty&rsquo;s tangled dark curls, &ldquo;that peculiar pride
which revolts at accepting anything of money value from
anybody outside one&rsquo;s own family. It is, perhaps, especially
a New England trait, and your own Irish heart
is so big it leaves no room for the Puritan instincts which
are also yours by inheritance. But Dorothy is right, dear,
and you must not repeat your offer to Jeanette, though I,
too, am sorry that it is not possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, if I could think of some way to give
her a dress without letting her know where it came from,
wouldn&rsquo;t that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, dear. She would know at once that you had
sent it, and would, of course, be offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I think people are just silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but you can&rsquo;t make the world different
in a moment. Come to luncheon now, and tell me all
about your own plans for the reception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; but, Mother, I&rsquo;m going to find some way for
Jeanette to go to it, too. I don&rsquo;t know how yet, but you
see if I can&rsquo;t fix it somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Betty; but don&rsquo;t do anything without consulting
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, and I haven&rsquo;t thought of anything yet,
but I&rsquo;m sure I shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the rest of that day, Betty thought hard, but it was
not until after she had gone to bed at night that an idea
flashed upon her. Such a beautiful idea! She wondered
that she hadn&rsquo;t thought of it sooner!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>She felt she must discuss it with her mother at once, for
if it wouldn&rsquo;t do, she wanted to think up something else.
But surely it would do! Such a grand idea <i>must</i> be all
right!</p>
<p>She jumped up and put on her blue kimono, and poking
her bare feet into little bedroom slippers of blue quilted
satin, she ran out into the hall and called over the banister:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, are you alone? May I come down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to the &ldquo;Yes, Betty dear; what is it?&rdquo; she
ran down-stairs, and, flinging a sofa-cushion on the floor,
nestled against her mother&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of the beautifullest
plan to give Jeanette a dress and not offend her! Oh,
do approve of it, Mother, please do! It&rsquo;s such a good
plan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, Betty, so that I can enjoy it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Mother, to-day&rsquo;s the tenth. So next
Saturday&rsquo;s the fourteenth&mdash;Valentine&rsquo;s Day, you know.
Now, I want to get a lovely dress for Jeanette, and make
it into a valentine, and send it to her! Don&rsquo;t you see,
nobody could get angry at a valentine, and you can&rsquo;t put
your name to it, and so she&rsquo;d have to keep it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked so radiant over her plan that Mrs. McGuire
hadn&rsquo;t the heart to disapprove of it, though she
felt a little dubious about its wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think it over,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But remember, Mother, I mean to make it like a
real valentine. Put it in a box, you know, and lace paper
around it, and sort of hearts and darts and things, and
a verse, a lovely, loving verse. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that effect would greatly help it, for valentines
nowadays often contain a lace handkerchief or bonbons or
something by way of a gift. Your plan seems to grow
on me, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, how lovely you are!&rdquo; Betty jumped up
from her low seat to give her mother a most enthusiastic
squeeze, and then, big girl though she was, stayed cuddled
in her arms while they continued the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you get a dress to fit her, my child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought about that. But if we just buy one all
ready-made, you know, about my size, I&rsquo;m sure it will
be about right for her. And Mrs. Porter can take it in
or let it out, or whatever it needs. A soft, white kind
of a one, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiffon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with lace here and there, and cunning little
ribbon bows, and knots of velvet, or something fancy-like
for evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go together to select it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon, after school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or next day. Of course you won&rsquo;t send it until
Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No; but we have to fix it up valentine-y, you know,
so we&rsquo;d better go to-morrow. Then we must write the
verse. Mother, won&rsquo;t you make up the verse? I don&rsquo;t
want a &lsquo;Roses red, violets blue&rsquo; sort of a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; skip back to bed, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can
do in the poetry line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you dear Mother! You <i>are</i> so sweet!&rdquo; And
with a final, rather smothering embrace, Betty said good
night, and ran back to her bed to dream of valentines and
Longfellow and Jeanette, all in a grand jumble.</p>
<p>It was hard next day to say nothing of her plan to
Dorothy, but Mrs. McGuire had decided if it were to be
successful it must be kept absolutely secret. So not even
Jack was told about it, and, after luncheon, Mrs. McGuire
and Betty started off to buy the frock. Mrs. McGuire had
slight misgivings about it all, but she determined to try
the experiment, for it was the only way that the thing
could possibly be accomplished, and she felt very sorry for
Jeanette. After looking at several pretty, girlish dresses,
they decided upon a lovely one of cream-white chiffon,
made over white silk. It had a soft lace bertha, bordered
with a wreath of tiny pink rosebuds. It was a simple,
dainty little gown, but very effective, and Betty agreed
that it would suit Jeanette perfectly.</p>
<p>The saleswoman was asked to provide an especially nice
box, and Betty examined it herself, to be sure that the
corners were unbroken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Then, with explicit directions about careful packing
and wrapping and speedy sending of it home, they went
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Mother, I must send Jeanette another
valentine, too; a real one, you know, so she won&rsquo;t suspect
about the dress. And, anyway, I want to buy at least
twenty other valentines to send. Will you go with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to another shop, and Betty bought valentines
for a few school-girls and other friends she had
made in Boston; for Jack and Polly and Grandma Jean,
and for some of her Greenborough friends.</p>
<p>Nor were Pete and Ellen forgotten, for Betty well knew
how they would prize valentines from her. And so engrossing
was the selection of all these that the afternoon
slipped away, and when they reached home, to their great
joy the new dress had already arrived.</p>
<p>Behind the locked doors of her mother&rsquo;s room, Betty
carefully lifted the lovely thing from its tissue-papers,
and exclaimed with delight at its beauty. It looked even
prettier than it had in the shop, and Betty was sure her
plan would be a fine success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire; &ldquo;at any rate, we&rsquo;ll try
it, and if it doesn&rsquo;t turn out as well as we hope, I&rsquo;ll take
the matter in charge, and go and see Mrs. Porter about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>The next afternoon Betty devoted to fixing what she
called the &ldquo;valentine-y&rdquo; part of it.</p>
<p>The big box was of fine white pasteboard, of a watered
design, with gilt edges, and the firm&rsquo;s name in gilt letters
on the cover.</p>
<p>Over this name Betty pasted a large valentine that completely
covered it.</p>
<p>Then, with considerable cleverness, she cut up several
other pretty valentines, and of the rose garlands and doves
and cupids she obtained in this way, she contrived a sort
of wreath, which, when pasted into place, made a border
all round the box cover.</p>
<p>Inside the box were two large leaves of satin paper
which closed like shutters over the dress when it was
folded in place. These leaves Betty decorated in similar
fashion to the cover, and replaced the white tapes with
narrow blue ribbons. The leaves closed together and
were fastened with a large red paper heart, garlanded
with flowers, and pierced by a gilt arrow.</p>
<p>Fastened to the heart by the arrow was the verse
Betty&rsquo;s mother had composed and had copied on the blank
page of a real valentine. This was in an embossed envelop
and was addressed &ldquo;<i>To Jeanette from St. Valentine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The verses which her mother wrote read thus:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">On Cupid&rsquo;s Day</p>
<p class="t">One may, they say,</p>
<p class="t0">Send tokens to a friend,</p>
<p class="t">Of love most true,</p>
<p class="t">As mine for you,</p>
<p class="t0">A love that ne&rsquo;er shall end.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Accept then, dear,</p>
<p class="t">The token here,</p>
<p class="t0">That tells this love of mine;</p>
<p class="t">Or else a dart</p>
<p class="t">Will pierce the heart</p>
<p class="t0">Of your fond Valentine.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, it is perfectly lovely!&rdquo; cried Betty, as she
read the verses. &ldquo;And, don&rsquo;t you see, saying &lsquo;from St.
Valentine&rsquo; is the same as saying &lsquo;from Santa Claus,&rsquo;
so I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think she&rsquo;ll mind, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this was about the fiftieth time Betty had asked
the same question, Mrs. McGuire could only make the
same reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, dear, but don&rsquo;t worry about it. If she
&lsquo;minds,&rsquo; I will undertake to set the matter right again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the box was carefully wrapped in white paper, and
sealed up with gilt hearts. Mrs. McGuire addressed it,
and she had also written the verses, for Jeanette would
have recognized Betty&rsquo;s penmanship at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>It was hard to wait for Valentine&rsquo;s Day, but, as Betty
had much to do getting ready her other valentines to be
dispatched, the time flew quickly. Jack also had many
to send, and as, except for the dress, Betty need make no
secrets of hers, they spent the afternoon of the thirteenth
together in the library, addressing the pretty missives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a beauty!&rdquo; said Jack, holding up a lovely
affair of gilt latticework, which, if you pulled a cord,
burst into a mass of flowers and birds. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll send
this to Jeanette Porter. She&rsquo;s one of the nicest girls we
know, don&rsquo;t you think so, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. She and Dorothy Bates are my dearest
friends, and they&rsquo;re coming over this afternoon, so let&rsquo;s
get theirs out of the way first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll send this one to Dorothy. She&rsquo;s a
jolly girl, but Jeanette&rsquo;s my choice. She&rsquo;s so quiet and
pretty-mannered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of Jeanette myself, Jack,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;and&mdash;oh,
here they come! Slip theirs in here, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They whisked the valentines into a table drawer, just
in time to escape the eyes of the girls as they came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Betty, gaily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re addressing valentines.
As there aren&rsquo;t any here for you two, you may
look at them all you like. I hope you&rsquo;re not expecting us
to send you any!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; said the visitors, laughing, for well they
knew they would all send valentines to each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it jolly that Valentine&rsquo;s Day comes on Saturday?&rdquo;
said Dorothy. &ldquo;I shall sit on the lowest step of
the staircase all day long to be ready to fly to the door
every time the bell rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls,&rdquo; cried Betty, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun if you&rsquo;d
all come over here to-morrow afternoon and bring your
valentines! We can have a regular show of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Dorothy, and &ldquo;So will I,&rdquo;
said Jeanette. &ldquo;Oh, what a beauty this is! Betty, I
don&rsquo;t see where you found such lovely ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s left over,&rdquo; said Betty, carelessly; &ldquo;you may
have it, if you care for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thoughtless words were no sooner spoken than
Betty&rsquo;s heart stood still with a sudden fear that Jeanette
would be offended again.</p>
<p>But, to her amazement, she replied as carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want it? Oh, thank you, I&rsquo;d love to have
it. I got mine at Morrison&rsquo;s, and they&rsquo;re not nearly so
pretty as this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty was bewildered.</p>
<p>Why was Jeanette so ready to accept a valentine, and
so angered at the offer of a dress? To be sure, the valentine
cost but a trifle, and the frock considerably more,
but that was a matter of degree, and if it was on account
of principle, Betty thought the cases were the same.
But Betty gave up trying to understand these fine distinctions,
and awaited results of her enterprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>On Saturday a messenger was sent with the precious
box. He was given special directions, if any one should
ask him where the box came from, not to give the slightest
hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo; said the boy, and taking the box
carefully, he went on his errand. Then there was suspense
indeed. Betty hovered near the telephone, though she
had no real reason to think Jeanette would call her up.
Had her mind not been distracted by the continuous arrival
of valentines to herself, she could scarcely have kept
from flying over to Jeanette&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>But valentines of all sorts and styles came pouring into
the house all day. Betty and Jack received them in every
mail, and also between mails by messenger.</p>
<p>Polly had enough to make her baby heart over-flow
with glee, and though she ruined most of them with her
affectionate pats and kisses, she liked them just as well
in their shabby condition.</p>
<p>About four o&rsquo;clock the young people arrived. Betty
had invited a dozen or more, both girls and boys, and
though valentines are particularly meant for the fair sex,
yet the boys had a goodly number to exhibit also.</p>
<p>The young folk gathered in the drawing-room and set
their treasures around on tables, mantels, piano, and even
on chairs, so many there were.</p>
<p>Eagerly Betty watched Jeanette to see what her demeanor
might be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>To her amazement, Jeanette was positively gay! She
seemed like one transformed. Her eyes danced, and her
face fairly beamed, as if she were bubbling over with
happiness.</p>
<p>Jack admired her more than ever, and wondered if the
receiving of a few valentines pleased her as much as all
that. Betty didn&rsquo;t quite understand, but she saw that
Jeanette was radiantly happy, and she felt sure that it
<i>must</i> be because of the new dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know the valentine <i>you</i> sent me, Betty!&rdquo; she
cried soon after she came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; said Betty, her heart in her throat with
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one!&rdquo; cried Jeanette, triumphantly holding up
the pretty paper valentine that Betty had sent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Jeanette,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I did send
you that, because I knew you&rsquo;d love that landscape with
the blue trees and green sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that way!&rdquo; cried Jeanette. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
make fun of my prettiest valentine of all&mdash;or nearly,&rdquo; she
added, with a funny little smile.</p>
<p>Betty was mystified, but said nothing, but after the
others had gone and only Jeanette and Dorothy remained,
she said, unable longer to restrain her curiosity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter with you, Jeanette? I never
saw you so gay and festive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I should think I would be!&rdquo; exclaimed Jeanette.
&ldquo;I waited till the others had gone, to tell you.
Girls, I&rsquo;m going to the reception!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; cried Dorothy. &ldquo;How perfectly lovely!&rdquo;
And Betty said: &ldquo;Oh, Jeanette, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to change your mind?&rdquo; asked
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had a dress for a valentine! The loveliest dress
you ever saw! It&rsquo;s just a dream! All filmy chiffon, and
the darlingest little pink rosebuds, and exquisite lace&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A valentine!&rdquo; cried Dorothy, and Betty said eagerly:
&ldquo;Who sent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Jeanette, turning her eyes on
Betty, so honestly ignorant that Betty knew she didn&rsquo;t
suspect in the least. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no idea. It came in the most
beautiful box, all fixed up like a lovely big valentine,
and the sweetest verse, all written out. I never saw the
handwriting before, and I can&rsquo;t imagine&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t the
least idea&mdash;who sent it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you glad?&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad? Well, I just guess I am. Now I can go to
the reception, and I&rsquo;m going to recite &lsquo;The Famine&rsquo;
lines from &lsquo;Hiawatha.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you any way to find out who sent
it?&rdquo;
persisted Dorothy, thereby asking the very question Betty
wanted to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t want to try. You see, you&rsquo;re not
supposed to know who sends a valentine, and of course it
would turn out to be Aunt Esther, or Grandmother Harrington,
and that would take away all the beautiful mystery
and romance. It&rsquo;s <i>so</i> lovely not to know where it
came from. It&rsquo;s a true valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; agreed Betty, her heart fairly bounding
with joy at the complete success of her little plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on home with me and see it,&rdquo; urged Jeanette;
but Betty felt she must tell her mother about it at once,
so she said, &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too late. I&rsquo;ll run over to-morrow to
see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then; be sure to come,&rdquo; and happy Jeanette
went away with Dorothy, leaving an equally happy
Betty behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you mind if she <i>never</i> knows you gave it
to her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. McGuire after she had the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Mother. What a question! The whole
trouble was for fear she <i>would</i> know that. And now she
has the dress, and she&rsquo;s so happy about it, indeed I <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
want her <i>ever</i> to know where it came from!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s own joy in the gift she had made was purely
unselfish, and she felt amply rewarded in the pleasure she
had given Jeanette.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>So when the night of the reception came, Betty took
quite as much satisfaction in seeing Jeanette in the lovely
and becoming frock as she did in wearing her own beautiful
new one.</p>
<p>And when Jeanette received the prize for her wonderfully
well-done recitation, Betty squeezed her mother&rsquo;s
hand and looked up at her with eyes fairly beaming in
triumph at the thought that she had made it possible
for Jeanette to win.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>

<br />THE PALACE OF TIME</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think the club ought to be for something that will
improve our minds,&rdquo; said Constance Harper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared Lena Carey; &ldquo;we get our
minds improved in school. I cram improvement every
day, until my mind is fairly bursting with it. I think the
club ought to be just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; agreed Betty. &ldquo;At least, I don&rsquo;t
vote for the improvement part. My mind needs improvement,
goodness knows! But I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;d ever
get much out of a club of our own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do think it ought to be for something besides
just fun,&rdquo; went on Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Lena. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t study or have papers, what can you do but have
fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it might be for charity,&rdquo; suggested Jeanette
Porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I mean. We can
have lots of fun getting up things for charity, and do
good besides.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like that, I think,&rdquo; Constance said; &ldquo;you can
have lovely fairs and garden-parties and all sorts of things
for charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have a garden-party just yet,&rdquo; said Lena,
as she drew closer to the blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Constance, a little shortly; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to. But I suppose the club will last through the
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it will,&rdquo; said Betty, who always interrupted
when Lena and Constance began their sharp little
speeches. &ldquo;And before summer comes we&rsquo;ll have an
entertainment in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now the first week in March, and, as the weather
was raw and disagreeable, the girls were glad to gather
in Betty&rsquo;s cozy library, and nestle in soft, cushioned chairs
drawn up to the big fireplace, with its crackling logs.</p>
<p>The four girls had come over for the express purpose
of forming a club of some sort, though the details of the
plan were not yet thought out. Of course, Jack had been
promptly excluded from the conference, as it was to be a
girls&rsquo; club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, as he went unwillingly away;
&ldquo;we boys will get up a rival club, and it&rsquo;ll be so jolly
you&rsquo;ll want to disband yours and join ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; when that happens, we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; sang out
Lena, as the door closed behind the reluctant Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>But after it was decided to have the club a charitable
one, no one could think of just the right form that it
should take. &ldquo;Mother went to a concert last night for
the aid of the Orphan Asylum,&rdquo; suggested Constance,
and Lena promptly responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they don&rsquo;t need our help. Let&rsquo;s think of something
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the Fresh Air Fund?&rdquo; said Jeanette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; cried Dorothy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather work
for little children than anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then; our object is settled,&rdquo; said Constance;
&ldquo;now what shall we name the club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait,&rdquo; said Lena; &ldquo;first we must elect officers
and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;we must decide on our members,
We five, of course, and I&rsquo;d like to ask Martha Taylor,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you can leave me out,&rdquo; said Constance, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly
silly, Constance. I don&rsquo;t see why you don&rsquo;t like
Martha. And she&rsquo;d feel slighted to be left out of a thing
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody likes Martha Taylor,&rdquo; observed Jeanette. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think we need ask her, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do! And if you don&rsquo;t, you may leave me
out, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty! Betty! Of course we wouldn&rsquo;t leave you
out! Why, there couldn&rsquo;t be a club without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. It&rsquo;s Martha Taylor, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not often that Betty asserted herself so strongly,
but when she did the others generally yielded the point.
Martha Taylor was not a favorite; although a member
of the girls&rsquo; class, none of them liked her, and she had
no chum and almost no friend. There was no especial
reason for this, for Martha was not ill-natured or disagreeable;
but she was heavy and uninteresting, and never
seemed to understand the others&rsquo; jokes and fun.</p>
<p>But Betty felt sorry for her, and, seeing she was neglected
by the other girls, she stood up for her and insisted
on having her for a member of the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to look after her,&rdquo; said Lena. &ldquo;I
never know what to say to her. She only says &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; when you ask her anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she won&rsquo;t make any trouble in the club, anyhow,&rdquo;
observed Jeanette. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why Betty wants
her, but if we have to have her, we have to, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have to,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m going to
telephone her now, and ask her if she wants to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever they may have thought, no one objected outwardly,
and Betty called up Martha on the telephone and
invited her over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Needless to say, the invitation was accepted, and soon
Martha appeared, looking greatly pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Martha,&rdquo; said Betty, most cordially, and made
a place for the new-comer by her side.</p>
<p>The others spoke pleasantly enough, but without enthusiasm,
and then the business meeting was begun.</p>
<p>After some discussion Betty was made president and
Dorothy vice-president, Lena Carey was treasurer, and
Constance was recording secretary, with Jeanette for corresponding
secretary.</p>
<p>This gave each an office with the exception of Martha,
and as soon as Betty saw how things were going, she
calmly created an office for her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nominate Martha Taylor for auditor,&rdquo; she said, in
her most decided way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Lena.</p>
<p>Now Betty wasn&rsquo;t quite sure herself what an auditor
was, or whether it was a usual office in a club, but she
didn&rsquo;t care. It made an official title for Martha, and so
kept her from feeling slighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An auditor?&rdquo; responded Betty, airily. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s
the one who looks over the books and accounts of all of
us, to see if we&rsquo;ve added up right, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a specially pleasing idea to the treasurer
and the two secretaries, but they understood Betty&rsquo;s determined
expression, and they submitted with good grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>So matters went on pleasantly, and Martha was greatly
elated at being chosen to fill what she considered a most
important office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t always add right myself,&rdquo; she said conscientiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind; I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling at her.
&ldquo;Now, girls, for a name. I don&rsquo;t like a high-sounding
name. Let&rsquo;s have something plain and straightforward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fresh Air Fund Club,&rdquo; suggested Lena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fresh Air Club is shorter,&rdquo; said Constance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fresh Club is shorter yet,&rdquo; said Dorothy, laughing,
&ldquo;and the boys will call us that, anyhow, when they
hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They decided on &ldquo;The Fresh Air Club,&rdquo; and then, all
business matters being settled, they proceeded to plan their
first entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have something really nice,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;We
can get Hetherton&rsquo;s Hall to hold it in, without paying
anything. My uncle is one of the managers, and I know
he&rsquo;d let us have it for a charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a most advantageous offer, and, had it come
from any one else, it would have been hailed with enthusiasm.
As it was, nobody said much, except Betty, who
exclaimed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Martha, that will be fine! If we don&rsquo;t have to
pay for the hall, we can make a lot of money, for that&rsquo;s
generally the biggest item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Constance; &ldquo;all the things to sell will
be given to us, or we&rsquo;ll make them ourselves. You mean
a sort of fair, don&rsquo;t you, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; only a special kind, you know&mdash;a bazaar, or
something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a bazaar?&rdquo; asked Martha, with such an air
of blank ignorance that Constance frowned at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bazaar,&rdquo; began Lena, &ldquo;why, a bazaar is&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a
bazaar. Anybody knows what a bazaar is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Martha, not much enlightened, but realizing
that she was supposed to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lena didn&rsquo;t explain it very clearly,&rdquo; said Betty laughing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I know the difference myself between
a bazaar and a fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Constance; &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re about
the same, only bazaar is the new-fashioned name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a bazaar is bigger,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;more elaborate,
you know, with booths and flags and things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you dress up in costumes at a bazaar,&rdquo; added
Jeanette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;I love dressing up in fancy
costumes. What sort do they wear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sometimes all sorts of costumes, and sometimes
just flower-girl dresses and things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean that sort of a fair, I read about one not
very long ago that might be very nice, I think,&rdquo; suggested
Martha, a little timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked Betty, as no one else expressed
any desire to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a bazaar of the months. Only you have
to have boys in it&mdash;six girls and six boys, and each one has
a table and sells things belonging to that month. Flowers
for May, you know, and fans for August, and all sorts of
things for Christmas, the December one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds lovely,&rdquo; said Dorothy kindly; &ldquo;but it would
be funny to sell Christmas things and valentines and fans
in March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;People could buy their
valentines and Christmas presents, and hide them away
till next year. I think it&rsquo;s a fine idea. Then each one
of us could dress up in a costume to fit the month, such
as the Queen of May or the April Fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Martha, &ldquo;but you have to have boys for
Fourth of July and April Fool and Santa Claus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will,&rdquo; declared Betty. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask six boys
to be honorary members of the club and help us with the
bazaar. Let&rsquo;s call Jack in now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed to this, and Jack came in, much pleased
to help with the great project.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>As the young people talked it over, it seemed to assume
grand proportions, and Betty proposed that they lay
the whole plan before her mother before they should proceed
further. Mrs. McGuire listened with great interest
as the purpose of the Fresh Air Club was explained to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; she said at last &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it will be
a lovely bazaar, there&rsquo;s room for such pretty decorations
and costumes. Have you chosen your parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t, but, with Mrs. McGuire&rsquo;s assistance, they
undertook the matter at once.</p>
<p>Everybody agreed that golden-haired Constance must
be the May Queen. She was just right for it, with her
blue eyes and fair, pretty face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I have a booth?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What shall I sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly a booth for you,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire,
&ldquo;but a bower, a real May Queen&rsquo;s bower. And you must
sell flowers, of course&mdash;not only nosegays, but potted
plants and ferns and things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wild flowers and pond-lilies! Oh, Constance,
your booth will be the prettiest of all!&rdquo; cried Dorothy, a
little enviously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find many wild flowers or pond-lilies in
March,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, smiling; &ldquo;but the florist will
help us out with many blossoms, and we may have to use
paper flowers for the bower. Dorothy, you are just the
one to be the Summer Girl; that&rsquo;s the one for August, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will! And I know just how I&rsquo;ll fix my booth!
I&rsquo;ve just thought of it. I say, girls, suppose we don&rsquo;t tell
all about our booths, but surprise each other! Just choose
our parts, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;choose away. Jeanette,
what month do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take June,&rdquo; said Jeanette, who already had a
pretty plan in her wise little head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want October,&rdquo; declared Lena, her eyes twinkling
as she thought of Hallowe&rsquo;en possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;September was represented by Diana in the bazaar I
heard about,&rdquo; said Martha; &ldquo;I think Betty ought to be
that. She&rsquo;d make a lovely Diana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would, Betty!&rdquo; said Constance. &ldquo;Do take that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; agreed Betty. &ldquo;What do I sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grapes,&rdquo; said Lena; &ldquo;but as you can&rsquo;t get grapes in
March, you&rsquo;ll have to sell grape jelly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can get hothouse grapes,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;But this
leaves only November for Martha. What can you be,
Martha&mdash;a turkey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;November isn&rsquo;t much of anything,&rdquo; said Martha.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of uninteresting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Constance, tossing her head; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
only one left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes flashed at this, but she only said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Martha, you take November. I&rsquo;ve a good
idea for it; I&rsquo;ll tell you afterward. Now let&rsquo;s fix up the
boys. What month do you want, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you ask me, I&rsquo;ll take January. I&rsquo;m great
on January.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; and we&rsquo;ll ask the other boys and let them
choose. Oh, I hope they&rsquo;ll all do it! Won&rsquo;t it be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fun, but it also proved to be a great deal of
work. Indeed, if the grown-ups hadn&rsquo;t helped them out,
the young people could scarcely have carried the affair
through. Grandpa Irving took a great interest in it from
the beginning, and planned so many improvements and
additions that the bazaar soon became a really large enterprise.</p>
<p>It was called &ldquo;The Palace of Time,&rdquo; and Mr. Irving
agreed to assume the character of old Father Time and
preside at the bazaar.</p>
<p>His principal aids were four ladies who represented the
four seasons, and who were to wear appropriate costumes
to designate Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
Each of these ladies presided over the three booths which
belonged to her season, and thus the success of the young
people&rsquo;s booths was made more sure.</p>
<p>The other boys had proved quite as pleased as Jack to
take part in the affair, and all of those who were to take
part, as well as many of their friends, worked hard during
the few weeks of preparation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>One thing Betty resolved, and that was that Martha
must have an attractive booth and one that should somehow
prove to be among the most popular. After she told
her grandfather how the other girls felt toward Martha,
Mr. Irving also declared that he, too, would look out for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, Betty,&rdquo; said her grandfather; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
just fix it so that Martha&rsquo;s booth will be crowded with
people all the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, though nobody knew exactly what Martha was
going to do, it was soon known that hers would be the
supper booth.</p>
<p>Lemonade was to be served by July; ice-cream by
August; flowers, of course, would be sold by May; and
candy would be found in the February booth.</p>
<p>But November being the month of Thanksgiving and
plenty, it was deemed appropriate to have the more substantial
refreshments on sale there.</p>
<p>Martha was delighted with the plan Mr. Irving proposed,
and, with the help of Miss Connington, the young
lady who took the part of Autumn, she made ready for
her November booth.</p>
<p>When the night of the bazaar came, everything was in
readiness, and hundreds of people were waiting for the
entrance-doors to open.</p>
<p>And when at last they were admitted, the beautiful
scene was greeted with great applause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>At the end of the room was the throne of Father Time.
This was on a raised platform, behind which was a large
sheet painted with the figures of the zodiac.</p>
<p>Time himself, who was, of course, Mr. Irving, was
robed in long white garments, which fell in classic folds
about his tall and stalwart frame. A white beard and
&ldquo;forelock&rdquo; added to the effect, and he carried a scythe
and hour-glass.</p>
<p>But his genial smile and cordial words of greeting were
not much like the grim old gentleman who is represented
as going about and cutting down all, both great and small.
Not wishing to shirk his part of the real work of the
evening, Mr. Irving had some small articles for sale on
his &ldquo;throne.&rdquo; There were hour-glasses and smaller sand-glasses;
clocks and watches; diaries and calendars; and
even a metronome, which, he said, he was particularly
anxious to dispose of, because it beat Time! As all these
articles had been donated, and as they were quickly bought
from the entertaining old gentleman, the funds of the
Fresh Air Club were considerably added to, that night, by
Father Time.</p>
<p>The young ladies who represented the four seasons
were dressed as if they were models for the pretty modern
picture calendars. They did not sell things, but hovered
round the booths that were under their supervision, and
took care that everything went right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The booths themselves were marvels of elaborate ingenuity.</p>
<p>January was what looked like a snow palace. It was
really a little mosque-shaped house, built of a light framework
covered with cotton-wool. This was sprinkled with
diamond-dust, and scattered bits of tinsel frosting, and
glass icicles. It was electric-lighted, and a more fairy-like
palace could not be imagined. Jack presided over
it in the guise of Jack Frost. His suit was white Canton
flannel sprinkled with tinsel frost, and his peaked cap
and roundabout jacket were trimmed with ermine&mdash;or
what looked like it.</p>
<p>He had on sale anything and everything that had to do
with January&mdash;skates, sleds, sleigh-bells, warm caps and
mittens, New Year&rsquo;s cards, year-books, and even soap-stones
and foot-warmers for sleighs. His booth was a
gay and cheery place, with a bright fire of gas-logs blazing,
and red-shaded lamps all about.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire had assisted, and many visitors thought
Jack&rsquo;s booth the finest of all.</p>
<p>Harry Harper, as St. Valentine, presided over the February
booth. He was dressed like the pictures of the old
saint, and in his booth were many cupids and doves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>The decorations were garlands of paper roses tied with
blue ribbons, and red hearts and gold darts of all sizes.
He had a real little post-office established, and did a thriving
business with the tender missives he had in stock. He
also had the candies, as they were &ldquo;sweets,&rdquo; and then
Harry, with a view to making more money, had declared
that he was entitled to use all the holidays that belonged to
his month, so he added a small tableful of souvenirs appropriate
to Washington&rsquo;s Birthday and Lincoln&rsquo;s Birthday.
There were little hatchets, and bunches of cherries,
and portraits of both Presidents, and these favors sold as
well as his valentines.</p>
<p>The next booth was March, and this was a funny one.
It represented a lion&rsquo;s den, and was a sort of cave which
was built partly of real rocks, and partly of huge boulders
made of wood and covered with brown muslin and moss.</p>
<p>Bob Carey was the lion, and as he had procured a
lion&rsquo;s &ldquo;make-up&rdquo; from a theatrical costumer&rsquo;s, he was
a fine animal. He said that, as March, he had to be either
a lion or a lamb, and he preferred the lion&rsquo;s part. It was
not easy to find articles for sale appropriate to March, but
he had succeeded in getting donations from the shopkeepers
of garden implements, such as rakes and spades
and hoes, which are useful in that month; also packets of
flower and vegetable seeds, and (which made every one
smile) a huge pile of sheet music, consisting only of popular
<i>marches</i>. He had, too, funny little souvenirs for St.
Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and so humorous was Bob himself, in his
character of the Cozy Lion, that he had many visitors.</p>

<p class="center">CONSTANCE IN THE MAY QUEEN&rsquo;S BOWER</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>April was in charge of Elmer Ellis, and he was an
&ldquo;April Fool.&rdquo; His costume was that of a court jester,
and the bells on his cap and on his bauble jingled merrily
as he played pranks on all who came his way. He had
no booth, but was under a huge umbrella, as, he explained,
it might rain at any minute in April. He sold umbrellas,
rubbers, rain-coats, sprinkling-cans, garden hose, and also
he had a stock of what were known as &ldquo;April Fool candies.&rdquo;
These he sold readily, for they are harmless fun
and cause great merriment. Also he sold bundles carefully
tied up with contents unknown, which &ldquo;fooled&rdquo; the
buyers.</p>
<p>Constance Harper was the May Queen and held court
under a beautiful arbor of vines and flowers. She wore
a white frock with flower garlands, and a long white veil
crowned with flowers.</p>
<p>She held a gilded scepter, and pages stood at either side
to wait on her Royal Highness. Her little slippered feet
rested on a satin cushion, and pretty Constance certainly
was the most attractive picture in the hall that night.</p>
<p>She sold flowers of all sorts&mdash;lovely growing plants and
ferns, and dainty baskets of blossoms, as well as tiny
nosegays and boutonni&egrave;res. Altogether, it was probably
the most beautiful booth of all, and it received great
admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>June was Jeanette Porter. She had not taken the idea
of the &ldquo;month of roses,&rdquo; but chose to represent a &ldquo;Sweet
Girl Graduate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over her white frock she wore a black silk gown, and
on her head a &ldquo;mortar-board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked like a fair, sweet Portia, and her wares were
all books. She did a fine trade, for Jeanette was a general
favorite, and the books found a ready sale.</p>
<p>July was in charge of Fred Brown, and he represented
&ldquo;Young America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although a big boy, he dressed himself in the garb of a
little one, and blew his tin trumpet and waved his flag
with all the boisterousness of a child of ten on Independence
Day.</p>
<p>His booth was a mass of flags and bunting and fireworks,
and he sold anything he could find that was patriotic,
from copies of the Declaration of Independence to a
package of torpedoes.</p>
<p>He also had the lemonade for sale, as that seemed to
him to be a Fourth of July beverage. He had persuaded
a few men, the best speakers he knew, to deliver occasional
short orations, so, with these attractive novelties, it was
no wonder that his booth was well attended all the time.</p>
<p>August was left to Dorothy Bates. She was one of the
prettiest of all, though one of the simplest in her costume
and manners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>She was a Summer Girl; and dressed in a white duck
outing-suit, her sailor-like blouse turned in at the throat
and turned back at the wrist, she was a charming picture.</p>
<p>She had no booth, but sat in a hammock beneath a
cleverly contrived shade-tree. About her, on what represented
grass and sand, were camp-stools, and her visitors
were served with ice-cream and little cakes. Also, she
sold fans and parasols, and so gay and winsome was
pretty Dorothy that the camp-stools were always occupied,
while others stood waiting their turn.</p>
<p>September was Betty&rsquo;s month. She had had a beautiful
Diana hunting-costume made for her, and in the dark-green
cloth, with its black braid and gilt buttons, Betty&rsquo;s
slim, straight young figure looked very picturesque. Her
booth was a sort of tent, with the flap turned back, and
she sold sporting goods of all sorts.</p>
<p>Some kind shopkeepers had donated fishing-rods and
reels, trout flies, game-bags, bows and arrows, and many
such wares. Betty was happy and gay, and her dark curls
clustered round her merry, rosy face as she wheedled her
patrons into making further purchases of all sorts of
wares.</p>
<p>October was Lena Carey&rsquo;s choice. She used all the
traditional features of Hallowe&rsquo;en, and in a semi-darkened
tent she told fortunes to gullible victims. Dressed as a
witch in a red robe, a black cape, and a red peaked hat,
she fondled her own pet black cat, though old Tabby would
not look weird and mysterious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The interior of Lena&rsquo;s tent was scarefully decorated
with bats and strange devices, and was adorned with
lighted Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns.</p>
<p>Lena was clever at fortune-telling, and, as her clients
were not exacting as to methods, she managed to satisfy
them all with most pleasant, even if most improbable,
promises for the future.</p>
<p>Next came November, which was Martha&rsquo;s. At first
it had not seemed easy to think of a character for Martha
appropriate to November. But as Betty looked at the
round, stolid face, full of wholesome good nature, but not
piquant or fascinating, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Martha! You&rsquo;re just like your grandmother.
Do chirk up and giggle sometimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then her own speech gave her an idea. &ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it! You shall be your own grandmother!
November is the Thanksgiving month, and the
very spirit of the Thanksgiving feast is the Grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So chubby-faced Martha was transformed into the dearest
old lady you ever saw&mdash;white hair, cap, and spectacles;
plain gray gown, with kerchief crossed on her bosom, and
knitting work beside her; everything of old-fashioned
style, even her reticule and black silk mitts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>

<p class="center">BOB CAREY, AS THE LION IN &ldquo;MARCH,&rdquo; SELLING MARCHES</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Mr. Irving, true to his word, assisted with Martha&rsquo;s
booth. It was indeed a realistic old-fashioned New England
kitchen, with its settings represented as faithfully
as possible. And the homely old New England supper
viands that were served there were so good and delectable
that Martha&rsquo;s booth was crammed with people from
opening to closing time.</p>
<p>December, as you&rsquo;d doubtless guess, was a Christmas
tree.</p>
<p>Although it was really March, so splendid was the great
tree, decorated, and lighted elaborately, and so jolly was
Ralph Burnett, who stood by as Santa Claus, that it was
difficult not to think it was Christmas eve.</p>
<p>On the tree everything was for sale. The wares first,
and, when they were gone, the decorations, and even the
electric lights and candles were sold.</p>
<p>Indeed, everything in the whole place was sold. As the
evening wore on, all the supplies gave out, and the frantic
&ldquo;months&rdquo; ran around to each other&rsquo;s booths trying to
beg or borrow something to sell. The cash-boxes were full
of jingling coins, yet the buyers were unsatisfied. The
Fresh Air Club had not expected such a large and generous
audience, and they stood in their dismantled booths,
resolved to have even a larger and finer bazaar, next
winter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, you see, Grandpa,&rdquo; said Betty to Mr. Irving,
&ldquo;Martha did have a successful part as November, and her
full share of custom. Why, Martha&rsquo;s kitchen was full of
people all the time. Constance was perfectly lovely, sitting
in state on her throne, but, now and then, there
weren&rsquo;t many people around her booth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Betty, sometimes people would rather eat than
buy flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s why I felt sure Martha&rsquo;s booth would be
a success. But, of course, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say anything to Constance
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Constance never mentioned the subject, but Martha
was never slighted by the girls again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">VI</span>
<br />BETTY&rsquo;S PRACTICAL JOKE</h2>
<p>One evening, soon after the bazaar, the McGuires were
dining with the Irvings, and naturally were discussing
the very successful entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; Mr. Irving remarked, &ldquo;that the young
chap who took the part of &lsquo;April Fool&rsquo; was one of the
hits of the evening. He was so merry and good-natured,
and yet so full of quips and pranks, why, he nearly fooled
me two or three times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, Grandpa,&rdquo; said Betty, saucily, &ldquo;it would
be easy enough to fool you; you&rsquo;re so&mdash;so honest and
good-natured, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving looked at the roguish, smiling face with pretended
severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Curlyhead! So you think it easy to
fool your simple-minded old grandfather, do you? Well,
little lady, you&rsquo;re greatly mistaken! In fact, you&rsquo;re quite
wrong! Fool me! Humph! Why, when I was in college,
the boys said I was the only one they could never play a
practical joke on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Mr. Irving looked very proud of his record for shrewdness,
but his eyes twinkled as he saw Betty&rsquo;s incredulous
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Mischief,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if you doubt
my word, try it. I&rsquo;ll wager you a hat you can&rsquo;t get off a
joke upon your unsuspecting old grandfather that I
don&rsquo;t see through before it reaches its climax. Fool me,
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to fool you, Grandpa,&rdquo; said Betty, demurely,
&ldquo;only I think I could&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little rogue, you do, do you? Well, the burden of
proof rests with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you wagered a hat,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling;
&ldquo;did you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my child, I&rsquo;ll own up that I said &lsquo;wager a hat,&rsquo;
because that&rsquo;s a slang phrase&mdash;or at least it was in my
youth&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything in particular, and I
said it without thinking. But I&rsquo;ll stand by it. You shall
have the prettiest hat in Boston if you succeed in playing
even the mildest little joke on your old grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Father,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
practical jokes are nice at all; and I don&rsquo;t think you ought
to put Betty up to such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule, my dear, I agree with you; and I don&rsquo;t
want Betty to get the habit of doing such things. But this
is an exceptional case. And, too, a good-natured joke
does no harm, especially if the victim invites it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re safe, Grandfather,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe Betty or anybody else could fool you.
You&rsquo;re too quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that compliment, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Irving; &ldquo;and then, too, remember that I am forewarned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Irving, laughing at the conversation;
&ldquo;I think your chances for a new hat from Grandfather
are slim, Betty dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t need a new hat&mdash;just now,&rdquo; said Betty,
thoughtfully, &ldquo;but, all the same, I&rsquo;d like to win that one,
and I&rsquo;m going to try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s dark head wagged in a determined fashion, and,
after a little further chaff, the subject was dropped.</p>
<p>But the next day Betty took it up again with Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to play a perfectly splendid joke on Grandpa,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;one that he will remember all his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Jack, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re modest in your desires,
aren&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do want to, Jack. Think what fun it would be!
Now, help me think of something, do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see; I can&rsquo;t think of things in a minute, you
know. But here&rsquo;s one thing; next Friday is the first of
April&mdash;you might play an April Fool Joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Betty, gleefully, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just the thing!
Anything is allowable on April Fool&rsquo;s Day. Now, what
shall it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, if you want a really fine affair, we must give
some thought to it. Neither do we want any simple joke
that we&rsquo;d make up ourselves. But let&rsquo;s try something
classic. Now there&rsquo;s an old story called &lsquo;Trajan&rsquo;s Jest,&rsquo;
or somebody&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ll look it up, and perhaps we can
adapt it to modern times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, I don&rsquo;t want any old Roman performance,
with togas and sandals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, goosey, not that. But just wait till I think it all
out. Oh, Betty, it&rsquo;ll be fine! Just you wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Betty waited while Jack looked into some reference
books, and when he found what he wanted, they soon
had their heads together over the volume. After an
hour of reading, chattering, laughing, and planning,
Jack said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, you see, it&rsquo;s all clear sailing, if you girls can
only carry it out in the right way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we can!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;Dorothy is so very
dramatic, and Jeanette will be lovely in her part. Mine is
the hardest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is; but it&rsquo;s your joke, you know. Shall
we tell Mother about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not&mdash;till it&rsquo;s over. It&rsquo;s all right, you know;
she wouldn&rsquo;t disapprove, but she&rsquo;d think we couldn&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if you ought to tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic9">

<p class="center">&ldquo;THESE TWO YOUNG WOMEN SAT BEHIND ME IN THE STREET-CAR AND OVERHEARD MY CONVERSATION WITH A FRIEND&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll tell her that we&rsquo;re going to play the joke.
Here she comes now. Come in, Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire came into the library where the children
were. &ldquo;What is it, dear?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve planned the joke for Grandpa,&rdquo; said
Betty, her eyes dancing with fun, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s going to take
a lot of acting. And, Mother, I don&rsquo;t want to tell
you about it till it&rsquo;s all over. You don&rsquo;t mind, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child; that is&mdash;I suppose, of course, it&rsquo;s nothing
wrong or impolite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; it&rsquo;s all perfectly correct and proper. Dorothy
and Jeanette and I are to do it, but Jack planned it all.
And, Mother, we&rsquo;ll want the big carriage on Friday
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, deary; now, mind, you are quite sure,
aren&rsquo;t you, I wouldn&rsquo;t disapprove?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; and Betty&rsquo;s honest eyes were clear and
frank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly joke, but there&rsquo;s nothing wrong about
it, is there, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; said Jack, chuckling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out
for the girls, Mother. The whole affair won&rsquo;t take an
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; go on. Your grandfather will be
as pleased as yourselves if it succeeds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>There was much more planning, and then, when the
whole affair was explained to Dorothy and Jeanette, they
entered into the scheme with glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be just like amateur theatricals!&rdquo; cried Dorothy,
clapping her hands. &ldquo;We must rehearse our parts. Oh,
won&rsquo;t it be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you dress up to look like a young lady?&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Not a disguise, you know, but just make yourself
look as if you were eighteen or twenty years old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; declared Dorothy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost sixteen,
anyhow. And I&rsquo;ll wear one of sister Ethel&rsquo;s dresses, and
do my hair up high. I&rsquo;ll wear a hat of hers, too, one of
her prettiest ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not too fancy, you know,&rdquo; warned Jack. &ldquo;You
must dress plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; I&rsquo;ll wear a small hat and a dotted veil.
Oh, I&rsquo;ll look grown up; never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanette will, too,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;she looks older than
she is, anyhow. What&rsquo;ll you wear, Jean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear one of Mother&rsquo;s gowns,&rdquo; said Jeanette, smiling.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so small and slender, her things just about
fit me. Black, I think, with white collar and cuffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wear a long cloak,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;and a thick,
dark veil, so Grandpa can scarcely see my face at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And glasses,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you a pair of dark
spectacles, so he won&rsquo;t see your eyes at all. Now let&rsquo;s
write the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>Then, all suggesting, but Jack doing most of it, the
following letter was composed, and was copied by
Jeanette:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Mr. William Irving</span>,</p>
<p><i>Dear Sir</i>: Although I have been in more fortunate circumstances,
I am now quite poor. I desire a position as secretary, and I apply
to you, because my great-uncle Roger Arundel used to be in your
class at college, and I have often heard him speak of your kind heart
and generous disposition. I will call at your office, to see you about
the matter, this afternoon at three o&rsquo;clock. Please let me speak to
you, even if you cannot give me a position.</p>
<p><span class="center">Yours truly,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Frances Arundel</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a Roger Arundel in Grandpa&rsquo;s class?&rdquo;
asked Betty, looking admiringly at the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of any,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;I made up the
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course there wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Why
didn&rsquo;t you choose a name from his class list?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t quite like to do that. It didn&rsquo;t seem
right. But it won&rsquo;t matter. You girls will have to manage
the Roger Arundel item. Now, are you sure you
understand your parts? Come on, let&rsquo;s rehearse. I&rsquo;ll be
Grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rehearsed for an hour or more, and declared they
understood their parts perfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must disguise your voice more, Betty,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;Talk as if you had a cold in your throat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>So Betty tried again and succeeded in achieving a
hoarse, harsh whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Jack, approvingly. &ldquo;Talk like
that and you&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the first of April came, and the other girls
came over to Betty&rsquo;s to start off together on their escapade.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire had been taken into the secret at the last
moment, thus having had no chance inadvertently to give
a hint to the unsuspecting victim.</p>
<p>She helped the three girls to make themselves look as
much as possible like full-grown young ladies. And, indeed,
the fact that they all wore long dresses and had
their hair done up high so changed their appearance that
little further disguise was necessary.</p>
<p>Dorothy wore a tailor-made suit of her sister&rsquo;s. It was
of dark-blue cloth and somewhat worn, an old one having
been chosen on purpose. A small blue straw hat, with a
few roses, was very becoming, and the effect of it, with its
carefully adjusted veil, was to make her look fully nineteen
or twenty years old.</p>
<p>Jeanette, in a plain little black suit and white shirt-waist,
looked a very demure young lady. Her trim black
hat showed no touch of color, and her sad little face
assumed a pathetic expression that made Jack laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, Jeanette!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just a
picture of &lsquo;a young lady in reduced circumstances.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>But Betty was the most disguised of all. This was necessary,
for Mr. Irving scarcely knew the other two girls,
anyhow, and the success of the scheme all depended on
his not recognizing Betty.</p>
<p>She wore a plain, dark dress borrowed from Dorothy&rsquo;s
sister. Over this was a long coat, rather loose and full, of
tan-colored cloth.</p>
<p>Her hair was drawn tightly back and done in a knot,
and she wore large, dark spectacles. Already there was
no resemblance left to Betty, but Mrs. McGuire added a
thick, dark-brown veil, which was draped loosely over her
face in old-fashioned style, and tied bunchily around her
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never know you in the world, Betty!&rdquo; declared
Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just all right! Now let&rsquo;s hear your
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Irving?&rdquo; said Betty, in such hoarse,
raucous tones that they all shrieked with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Jack, critically; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t overdo
it. Remember, you don&rsquo;t want Grandfather to suspect
you. Now come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and the three girls got into the carriage and were
driven to Mr. Irving&rsquo;s office in the city.</p>
<p>It was half-past two when they reached the building.
&ldquo;Just right time to a dot,&rdquo; said Jack, looking at his
watch. &ldquo;Go on up, Dorothy; are you nervous?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; returned Dorothy, smiling, as she left
the carriage. &ldquo;Be sure to send the others in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me!&rdquo; said Jack, and Dorothy entered the big
building and went up in the elevator.</p>
<p>She went to Mr. Irving&rsquo;s offices, and was admitted by a
clerk, who said Mr. Irving was in his private office, and
asked the visitor&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No name is necessary,&rdquo; said Dorothy, in very
grown-up tones. &ldquo;I am expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked past the clerk and into the inner office. Mr.
Irving looked at her in perplexity as she entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Frances Arundel,&rdquo; said Dorothy, looking a little
shy, as she approached the desk. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get my
note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rsquo;m&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, hastily turning over
some notes and letters before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a bit early,&rdquo; went on Dorothy; &ldquo;I wrote I
would be here at three o&rsquo;clock, but I was so anxious to
secure a position, I came earlier. Can you employ me,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked imploringly at Mr. Irving, who, to tell the
truth, had quite forgotten the note he had received an
hour or so before. He had read it hastily and intended,
when the writer came, to turn her over to his clerk; but
Dorothy&rsquo;s earnest face arrested his attention, and he
paused as he was about to ring the bell for his attendant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of Roger Arundel,&rdquo; he said, glancing at
the note he held in his hand. &ldquo;I never knew any one by
that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t, sir?&rdquo; Dorothy exclaimed, looking greatly
surprised. &ldquo;Why, wasn&rsquo;t he in your class at college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he was not,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, decidedly. &ldquo;What
college did he attend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; faltered Dorothy, &ldquo;but&mdash;it must have
been some other William Irving, then. But, please, can&rsquo;t
you find me some employment? I am greatly in need of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving looked at the agitated girl, and felt sorry
for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; he said, not unkindly. &ldquo;Have
you had any experience in clerical work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clerical work?&rdquo; said Dorothy, opening her eyes.
&ldquo;Do you mean church work? I belong to the Sunday-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It chanced that Dorothy had never heard the word
&ldquo;clerical&rdquo; used before, and she imagined it referred to
the clergy.</p>
<p>Mr. Irving bit his lips to keep from smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean office work,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;have you ever been in
an office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sir; you see, we just lost our money lately.
But I&rsquo;m sure I could learn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a stenographer? Can you type-write?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not either. But I can write a good hand, and
I&rsquo;m quick at figures. Couldn&rsquo;t I copy letters for you?
I&rsquo;m very tidy about my papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, well, we don&rsquo;t have our letters copied by hand.
I&rsquo;m afraid, Miss Arundel, I can&rsquo;t give you a position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, sir,&rdquo;&mdash;Dorothy&rsquo;s lip quivered a little,&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;re
quite poor. Mother tried to take in sewing, but
she&rsquo;s ill now, and&mdash;and I&rsquo;m the only support of the family.
Do let me address envelopes or something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving was very much embarrassed. He had never
had an experience just like this before. Clearly, the
girl was a refined little gentlewoman, and all unused to
the business world.</p>
<p>He judged her to be about eighteen or twenty, and wondered
what he could do for her.</p>
<p>He looked over the letter again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say your great-uncle spoke of me? Where is
your uncle now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s not living, sir,&rdquo; said Dorothy, looking
down. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re the Mr. Irving he meant,
because he said you were so kind-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally this touched the old gentleman&rsquo;s heart, and
he truly wanted to help the girl. But in his office he employed
only skilled workers, and there was no place for
Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul, child,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to do with you! Arundel&mdash;Roger Arundel. No, he
was not in my class, but he may have been in the college
while I was there. However, I&rsquo;d be glad to help you if I
could,&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t think of a thing for you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Dorothy, but with a hopeful inflection in
her tone, as if perhaps he might yet think of something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I simply <i>must</i> get work.
So of course I came here first, I felt so sure you&rsquo;d help
me if you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes; of course. Now, let me see&mdash;let me see.
You say you&rsquo;re good at figures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose you try adding up these columns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving took down a book of accounts, and opened
it at random.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here now, here now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t put your
figures on the page; they may be wrong. Add these columns
on a separate sheet of paper&mdash;so&mdash;and let me think
what I can do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy took the pad of paper and the pencil he gave
her, and going to a seat at a side-table, she began to add.
So excited was she over the way the plan was working,
she could scarcely see the figures at all, but she added
away industriously, now and then peeping at Mr. Irving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>He was intently studying the note, and occasionally he
would look off into space, as if trying to recall Mr. Roger
Arundel!</p>
<p>In a few moments the door opened, and the office boy
said: &ldquo;A lady to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo; said Mr. Irving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, sir; she just wrote it on this paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving took the paper from the boy, and read on
it, &ldquo;Miss Frances Arundel.&rdquo; He gave a start and
glanced at Dorothy. She was looking at him with horror-stricken
face, and just then Jeanette came in at the door,
closing it behind her, and leaving the office boy outside.</p>
<p>Jeanette looked quietly at Mr. Irving, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get my letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a letter from Frances Arundel, yes,&rdquo; said the old
gentleman, who was fast getting bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote it,&rdquo; said Jeanette, calmly. &ldquo;I hope you can
give me some work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote it!&rdquo; said Mr. Irving. &ldquo;Then who is that
lady there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanette turned a casual glance at Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;are you
asking me who that lady is? Isn&rsquo;t she your secretary
or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s Frances Arundel,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving,
grimly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Jeanette; &ldquo;what nonsense! <i>I</i> am
Frances Arundel. I wrote that letter you hold in your
hand, and I have called to see if you can give me a
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote this letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did. I also wrote on the paper which
I just gave to your office boy. If you will compare the
two, you&rsquo;ll find them the same penmanship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed sensible enough, and Mr. Irving looked
at both papers, and as Jeanette had written the letter,
a glance was sufficient to show that they were indeed by
the same hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, looking
sternly at Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; pleaded the little rogue, looking very
sad and remorseful; &ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have done it, I know,
but I overheard this lady in the street-car saying she
was coming to see you to-day, to ask you for a position,
so I thought I&rsquo;d come ahead of her, and&mdash;and&mdash;maybe
I could get it. I need it more than she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy cast a beseeching glance at Jeanette, who returned
it with a haughty look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help what she needs,&rdquo; said Jeanette, turning
away from Dorothy, who was pretending to be almost
weeping. &ldquo;I came to ask you for a position, not out of
charity, but because my uncle was your chum at college,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving; &ldquo;I never heard of
Roger Arundel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must have forgotten him, then,&rdquo; said
Jeanette, tossing her head, as if it were a matter of no
moment. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like a position all the same. I&rsquo;m
a competent secretary, and can give satisfaction, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Irving was at his wits&rsquo; end. He looked at the two
young ladies&mdash;Dorothy crumpling her handkerchief into
her eyes, and looking very forlorn and pathetic; Jeanette
rather haughty and dignified, with an air of standing
her ground in spite of the impostor who was trying to
take her place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are experienced, you say?&rdquo; he said, turning to
Jeanette, and thinking that, if she were indeed competent,
he might find a place for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied, taking off her gloves; &ldquo;shall
I go right to work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless my soul, no!&rdquo; cried the flurried old gentleman.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t engaged you yet. I don&rsquo;t do things on
the jump like that. Look here, Miss&mdash;you first one&mdash;what&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Crane,&rdquo; said Dorothy, saying the first name that
came into her head, and feeling that she couldn&rsquo;t keep
up the game much longer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Mary Crane, you go on with your adding,
and I&rsquo;ll look into your case later. It seems to me
you were pretty sharp to pick up information on a street-car
and put it to use so quickly! Did you overhear all
that Arundel business, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; stammered Dorothy, who was, in truth,
nearly choking with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a quick-witted young person, whatever else
you may be. Now you go on and add. Miss Arundel,
I&rsquo;ll talk with you. You say you&rsquo;ve had experience.
Where have you worked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanette looked blank. This question had not been in
her rehearsals, and she was not as quick at invention as
Dorothy. While she hesitated, the door opened again,
and Betty walked in unannounced. She closed the door
behind her, and said, in a hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Irving, I am Miss Arundel. I called to see you
in hopes you could give me employment of some sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Irving. &ldquo;Bless my
soul!&rdquo; And he sat helplessly looking at the three
girls.</p>
<p>He had no suspicion of Betty&rsquo;s identity, for her long
garments and thick veil and dark glasses were a complete
disguise.</p>
<p>The other two he had seen but once or twice, and of
course did not recognize them in grown-up attire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Not a notion of a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; entered his mind, but he
was mystified by what appeared to be a most extraordinary
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are Miss Frances Arundel?&rdquo; he said, looking
directly at Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied hoarsely, but steadily. &ldquo;I came
to see you about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your note,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, the paper being
still in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t write you any note,&rdquo; said Betty, in well-feigned
surprise. &ldquo;I just came in now, hoping I&rsquo;d find
you in, because I wanted to ask you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For employment, because I used to know your Uncle
Roger!&rdquo; Mr. Irving almost shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, seemingly pleased, &ldquo;but how did
you know about Uncle Roger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I have your note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I tell you I wrote no note. Let me see it,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty scanned the letter, and then said, very gravely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Irving, I didn&rsquo;t write that. Some impostor
must have represented me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of them, in fact,&rdquo; said Mr. Irving; &ldquo;here they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked at Dorothy and Jeanette, seeming to
notice them for the first time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand,&rdquo; she said angrily; &ldquo;these two
young women sat behind me in the street-car, and they
must have overheard my conversation with a friend to
whom I confided my plan of coming to you. Did they
claim to be Miss Arundel? Which of them did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both!&rdquo; said Mr. Irving, who had grown deeply interested
in the queer affair. &ldquo;They must have deceived
each other as well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy and Jeanette were the personification of discovered
culprits.</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s face was buried in her handkerchief, and
she shook convulsively, apparently with sobs, but really
with suppressed laughter. Jeanette looked crestfallen,
but still haughty and independent. Her manner seemed
to say that she had been discovered, but she was ready to
face the consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own up,&rdquo; she said, as Mr. Irving seemed to want
an explanation. &ldquo;This other young lady and myself
overheard Miss Arundel, and we both tried to get the
position ahead of her. I&rsquo;m sorry we failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanette&rsquo;s high and mighty air was almost too much
for Betty, but, as a spasm of laughter seized her, she
managed to turn it into a fit of coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a fearful cold,&rdquo; she said, still whispering
hoarsely, &ldquo;but it will be better soon. Did you say you
had a position for me? I need money very much and I
know you&rsquo;ll help me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul! I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; exclaimed poor Mr.
Irving, who was totally bewildered now by the trio of
poverty-stricken girls. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give out positions. My
assistants do that. What do you want, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short pause followed this sentence, and then, throwing
off her veil with one hand, and pulling off her glasses
with the other, Betty cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a hat, Grandpa! I want a hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; gasped Mr. Irving, dropping back
into his chair. &ldquo;<i>Betty!</i> bless my soul!&rdquo; and then, as the
other girls took off their veils and broke into bursts of
laughter, Betty snatched up the desk calendar, which
stood at April 1, and held it before her grandfather&rsquo;s
dazed eyes.</p>
<p>Rapidly, then, it dawned upon him. The laughing
girls, the date of April 1, and Betty&rsquo;s demand for a hat,
were the missing links to a full understanding of it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect success, Betty!&rdquo; cried Jack, coming up to
the jolly group when he heard the laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it!&rdquo; cried Betty; &ldquo;<i>was</i> it, Grandpa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scamp!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you rogue! you mischief!&rdquo;
and seizing Betty, he kissed her rosy cheeks in hearty
appreciation of her clever practical joke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say it was!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Irving,
who was, as Mrs. McGuire had prophesied, quite as much
pleased with the whole thing as were the jokers themselves.
Then Dorothy and Jeanette were greatly complimented
on their pretty acting; and Jack, as his share
of the performance was explained, also received commendation
from the old gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best joke ever!&rdquo; Mr. Irving exclaimed,
going off again and again in peals of laughter. &ldquo;How
did you get in, Betty? I&rsquo;ve given orders to admit no
one when I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I just told them I was Betty,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The
boy looked at me suspiciously at first, but when I spoke
without my &lsquo;cold,&rsquo; of course he knew me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little witch! Nobody ever tricked me before!
Now, you, each of you, and Jack too, can get the very
best hats you can find in Boston and send the bill to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goody, Grandpa, that will be great fun!&rdquo; cried
Betty. &ldquo;But you go with us, won&rsquo;t you, to pick them
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we can&rsquo;t go in these rigs. But we&rsquo;ll hurry home
and put on our own frocks; then we&rsquo;ll come back here
for you, and we&rsquo;ll all go hatting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; don&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; we&rsquo;ll be back in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">VII</span>
<br />THE GREEN PAPER DOLL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Betty, I&rsquo;m so upset!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy Bates,
as she came into the McGuire library one afternoon
in early May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Dotty?&rdquo; asked Betty. &ldquo;The party
isn&rsquo;t off, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;re to go, all right; but Jeanette can&rsquo;t go.
She has such a cold, her mother won&rsquo;t let her go away
from home. And I&rsquo;ve just come from there. She really
is ill; isn&rsquo;t it too bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed it is! We would have had such a lovely
time, all together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll go, anyhow. And, Betty, as Irene expects
three of us, I think it would be nice to ask some one to go
in Jeanette&rsquo;s place. I&rsquo;d like to ask Constance Harper, but
I know you don&rsquo;t like her very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I like Constance well enough, but she doesn&rsquo;t like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whichever way it is, you two never seem to get
along very well together. But who else is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty hesitated a minute, then she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask Martha Taylor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha! Why, Betty, nobody likes Martha. And
well&mdash;you know Martha, poor girl, has to count every
penny, and&mdash;and she never seems quite at her ease&mdash;not
that that&rsquo;s anything against her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t
have pretty dresses and hats, and the people at Halstead
House are often dressy and gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it; but if Martha doesn&rsquo;t mind that, we needn&rsquo;t.
And, Dorothy, you don&rsquo;t know Martha as well as I do.
She never has any good times, and it&rsquo;s that that makes
her shy and awkward. Oh, do ask her to go with us, if
only for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, what a queer girl you are! I like Martha well
enough, but I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll go with us. I&rsquo;ll ask her,
though, as you&rsquo;re so set upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this enthusiastic discussion all about?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. McGuire, pausing at the library door, as she was
passing through the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother, come in!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;What do you
think? Jeanette is quite ill and she can&rsquo;t go with us to the
house-party at Irene Halstead&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad; I&rsquo;m very sorry. Shall you ask any
one in her place, Dorothy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re talking about, Mrs. McGuire.
Betty thinks it would be nice to ask Martha Taylor, but I
don&rsquo;t think she quite fits in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But think how she&rsquo;d enjoy it! Martha almost never
gets invited to a lovely outing like this one you have in
prospect. Why, she&rsquo;d be overjoyed to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, I s&rsquo;pose she would,&rdquo; admitted Dorothy; &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s so bashful, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mostly because you girls slight her. Now you&rsquo;ve
a fine opportunity to give her a pleasure, do it, and do it
heartily and kindly. Let her feel that you really want her
to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;and, truly, Dot, if you ask her
as if you wanted her, and if you treat her cordially, you&rsquo;ll
be surprised to see how gay and jolly Martha will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Dorothy, agreeably; &ldquo;I really do like
her, and I&rsquo;ll do my best. Come on, Betty, let&rsquo;s go and ask
her now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty whisked away, and returned in a few minutes with
her hat on, ready to start. It was but a short walk through
the bright May sunshine to Martha&rsquo;s house, and they found
her in the garden, watering some flower seeds she had just
planted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Martha!&rdquo; called the two girls, and she came
running to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sit on the veranda,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so pleasant
there. I&rsquo;m glad you came to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to invite you to a party,&rdquo; said Dorothy,
plunging into the subject at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A party!&rdquo; exclaimed Martha. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Martha,&rdquo; cried Betty, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s more than a party&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a house-party! At a lovely country place,&mdash;Dorothy&rsquo;s
cousin&rsquo;s,&mdash;and we&rsquo;re to stay from Wednesday till Saturday!
Isn&rsquo;t that grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so grand that Martha could scarcely realize it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For three whole days! Oh! what
a party!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s going to be lovely,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;A May
party on Friday, and lots of picnics and things on the other
days. Will you go with us, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I will! I&rsquo;m sure Mother&rsquo;ll let me. But, girls,
I don&rsquo;t know if my clothes are good enough for such a
grand place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think about that.
Just come on and have a good time, and never mind what
you wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Taylor was delighted to have Martha go with the
other girls, and at once set about furbishing up her wardrobe
as best she could.</p>
<p>And, indeed, when at last the day came to start, Martha,
in her trim, neat traveling-suit, looked almost as well
dressed as the other two. They were to travel in charge of
Mr. Halstead, Dorothy&rsquo;s uncle, who was returning to his
country home after a short business trip to Boston.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>He was a genial, affable sort of man, but after a little
kindly conversation he left the girls to entertain themselves,
and became absorbed in his paper.</p>
<p>Martha was as happy as a bird. The prospect of the
good time coming seemed to transform her, and she
was so gay and merry that Dorothy concluded she
had misjudged her, and that Betty was right about
her.</p>
<p>When they at last reached Halstead House, Irene was
on the veranda to greet them.</p>
<p>She kissed her cousin Dorothy and greeted her warmly,
and then welcomed the other two as Dorothy introduced
them.</p>
<p>Neither Betty nor Martha had ever met Irene before,
but Mrs. Halstead had written for Dorothy to bring two
friends with her, and so the girls were at once made welcome.</p>
<p>Two other girls were visiting Irene, so the house-party
numbered six young people, and a gay flock they were.
Maude Miller and Ethel Caswell were from New York, and
proved to be pleasant and kindly, so Martha was not shy
or embarrassed, and soon the half-dozen were chatting
away like old friends.</p>
<p>Halstead House was a large colonial mansion with innumerable
rooms and wide porches and gardens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Irene was the eldest child, and there were also a small
boy and a baby girl of three. The little Daisy reminded
Betty of Baby Polly, and she made friends with her at
once.</p>
<p>Friday was Irene&rsquo;s birthday, and in honor of it there was
to be a May party, with a May-queen, May-pole, and all the
traditional features. Of course this was the principal
event of their visit, but the six girls managed to have a lot
of fun besides. There was a lake on which to row, a pony-cart
to drive, tennis-courts, croquet-grounds, and everything
that could make country life pleasant.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon the girls decided to walk down
to the village.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant walk along shady roads, and in a short
time they found themselves in the tiny hamlet, with its
little post-office and two or three small shops.</p>
<p>Martha had been in especially gay spirits all the way.
She had laughed and joked until Dorothy began to feel she
had reason to be proud of her merry friend instead of
ashamed of her.</p>
<p>But Betty looked at Martha curiously. She couldn&rsquo;t
quite understand her to-day. Several times Martha had
started to say something to Betty, and then stopped, as if
afraid the others would hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Martha?&rdquo; asked Betty, at last, dropping
a little behind the others. &ldquo;What are you trying to
say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Martha, turning red and looking
embarrassed. Then, as if with a sudden determined effort,
she turned to the whole group and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you&mdash;won&rsquo;t you&mdash;all come in and have ice-cream
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a pleasant invitation, but Martha stammered so
and seemed so nervous about it that Irene hesitated before
replying. Betty hesitated, too, for she knew that Martha
had little, if any, spending-money, and she wondered at
this unexpected hospitality.</p>
<p>But Martha turned pleading eyes upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make them come, Betty!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be so glad if
they would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, girls,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Indeed, Martha, we&rsquo;re
very glad to accept your invitation; it&rsquo;s so warm and
dusty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy, though mystified at Martha&rsquo;s sudden r&ocirc;le of
Lady Bountiful, took her cue from Betty and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely! I&rsquo;m just famishing for ice-cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others accepted gracefully, too, and they all went
into the latticed inclosure where ice-cream was sold. There
were many little tables and chairs, and pushing two tables
together, the girls all sat round, and Martha asked each one
to choose her favorite flavor.</p>
<p>Martha looked very happy and a little excited; her cheeks
were red and her eyes bright, and Betty thought she had
never seen her look so pretty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we having a good time?&rdquo; said Ethel Caswell,
as they slowly ate the refreshing dainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Maude Miller. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn to
treat next. Let&rsquo;s come down here again to-morrow morning,
and I&rsquo;ll buy the ice-cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed the others, and Betty and Dorothy
secretly resolved to find some pleasant way to do their share
of the &ldquo;treating.&rdquo; Martha beamed with pleasure to think
she had been the one to start a round of merry times, and,
as an additional touch to their present feast, she ordered
some small cakes. Betty and Dorothy looked frankly
astonished, for it was an expensive little place, and they
wondered if Martha knew how much her &ldquo;spread&rdquo; would
cost.</p>
<p>But Martha smiled so gaily that they couldn&rsquo;t offer any
remonstrance, and the pretty cakes were brought and enjoyed
by all.</p>
<p>When at last the little feast was over, the check was
brought and handed to Martha. Betty didn&rsquo;t see the
amount, but she saw that again Martha turned scarlet
and looked embarrassed. But, with an air of endeavoring
to look unconcerned, she drew a crisp, new five-dollar
bill from her purse, and then, receiving her
change, she put it away with the same elaborate carelessness,
not stopping to separate the notes from the
silver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter with Martha?&rdquo; thought Betty.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to act a part, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back walked the merry half-dozen girls to beautiful
Halstead House, and grouped themselves on the veranda
to wait for dinner-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build air-castles,&rdquo; said Irene. &ldquo;What would
yours be, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that <i>could</i> be real, or <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that could be real, but aren&rsquo;t likely to be, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Betty, promptly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d be a
princess, with golden hair all twined with pearls; and
a long white satin train, with little page-boys holding
it; and slaves fanning me with long peacock-feather
fans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, how fine!&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s too story-booky
for me. My air-castle is just to travel all over the
world&mdash;not by any magic, but just travel in real cars and
boats, and see all the countries there are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a nice air-castle,&rdquo; commented Irene.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d like to be famous; a great celebrity, you know.
I don&rsquo;t care whether it&rsquo;s in the musical or artistic or literary
line. But I&rsquo;d like to feel, and to have other people
feel, that I&rsquo;d done something grand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you ever will,&rdquo; said Maude, laughing.
&ldquo;Now, my air-castle is awfully prosaic. I&rsquo;d like to be a
nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a funny air-castle!&rdquo; exclaimed Martha.
&ldquo;How can you like to be mixed up with sickness and medicines
and such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I should like. And then to feel that I
was helping to make people well! Oh, I think that&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I s&rsquo;pose it is,&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;Mine isn&rsquo;t so
noble; I&rsquo;d just like to be at the head of a big house&mdash;about
like this&mdash;and have a lot of money. Not a great fortune,
but just enough to entertain my friends and give them
good times&mdash;just as Mrs. Halstead does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very pretty, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Halstead herself,
who had just stepped out on the veranda to summon
the young people to dinner. And again Martha became
embarrassed and blushed rosy red, as Mrs. Halstead smiled
at her kindly.</p>
<p>The next day was fair and beautiful, a perfect day for a
May party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a few days past the first of May, which is the real
May-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Halstead, at breakfast, &ldquo;but as it&rsquo;s
Irene&rsquo;s birthday, we thought we&rsquo;d celebrate it by a May
party. So it&rsquo;s an afternoon affair, from four to seven, and
we&rsquo;ll have a May-pole dance to wind up with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a May-queen?&rdquo; asked Betty. &ldquo;Queen Irene, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Halstead, &ldquo;Irene will be queen, as it&rsquo;s
her party. And all you girls must be ladies-in-waiting.
You may make wreaths for yourselves and trim your
dresses with flowers or garlands any way you choose.
Now, scamper, and don&rsquo;t bother me, for I&rsquo;ve lots of things
to attend to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t we help you, Mrs. Halstead?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. There&rsquo;s really nothing you could do to
help. Indeed, you&rsquo;ll assist me most by entertaining yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ethel. &ldquo;As Maude has invited us to
go to town with her, we&rsquo;ll have that to entertain us this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as they walked out of the dining-room and through
the broad hall, Maude said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take back my invitation, girls. I&rsquo;m not
going to take you to get ice-cream this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried Ethel, impulsively, and then, as they
all saw that Maude did not smile, they felt rather uncomfortable.</p>
<p>For a few moments nobody spoke, and then Betty, to
change the subject, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s play tennis, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was a constraint over them all, and no one
knew exactly why.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>To be sure, it was strange for Maude to invite them to go
for ice-cream, and then to recall her invitation so suddenly.
But they each felt there was more than that in the air,
and Maude looked so disturbed that it seemed there must
be something serious the matter.</p>
<p>So strong was the conviction that it would prove embarrassing,
that Betty repressed her inclination to invite the
girls to take ice-cream with <i>her</i> instead of Maude.</p>
<p>Instinctively she felt she had better not do this, and so
she proposed tennis instead.</p>
<p>Half-heartedly they went for their rackets, and as they
went toward the courts, Irene and Maude fell behind and
talked in whispers. Then they turned and went back to
the house.</p>
<p>The other four went on, and had nearly finished a set
of tennis when the two rejoined them.</p>
<p>Maude looked angry, and Irene looked as if she had
been crying, but no questions were asked, and no information
was offered as to the cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my racket,&rdquo; said Betty to Maude, &ldquo;and play a
set with Martha. I&rsquo;d just as lief sit and watch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Maude. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty looked up suddenly at this, and saw Maude give
Martha a contemptuous glance and turn away.</p>
<p>Martha turned red and looked dismayed, as she well
might at such a speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, ready to take
up the cudgels for Martha, if need be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said Maude. &ldquo;Martha knows what
I mean!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; stammered Martha, choking with mortification
at being thus spoken to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do!&rdquo; said Maude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much
obliged for your <i>ice-cream</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty, what does she mean?&rdquo; cried Martha, turning
helplessly toward her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,&rdquo; said Irene, looking angrily
at Maude. &ldquo;Mother told you to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maude turned sullen, and refused to say anything.
Betty looked mystified, but wasn&rsquo;t sure whether she ought
to insist on an explanation or not.</p>
<p>She had been responsible for bringing Martha, and if
Maude didn&rsquo;t like her, it was unfortunate, but to discuss it
might only make matters worse.</p>
<p>Dorothy, with her ready tact, came to the rescue. &ldquo;You
four play,&rdquo; she said, throwing down her racket, &ldquo;and
Maude and I will go for a row on the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maude brightened up at this, and Betty concluded
that she had been merely ill-tempered over nothing, after
all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>

<p class="center">&ldquo;TAKE MY RACKET,&rdquo; SAID BETTY, &ldquo;AND PLAY A SET WITH MARTHA&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you,&rdquo; said Maude to Dorothy, as they
pushed out on the lake, &ldquo;but I promised Mrs. Halstead I
wouldn&rsquo;t say anything to Martha about it. I&rsquo;ve lost five
dollars, and I can&rsquo;t help thinking she took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Mrs. Halstead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, no! Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never! I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you notice that new five-dollar bill she
paid for the ice-cream with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was exactly like mine. You see, I had a new, crisp
bill that Father gave me to spend while I was here. And
when we went to town yesterday, I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t take
it for fear I&rsquo;d lose it. And Martha, or somebody, must
have taken it, for when I got home it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Martha took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could have done it? Mrs. Halstead says she
knows her servants didn&rsquo;t take it. She&rsquo;s had them
for years, and they&rsquo;re perfectly honest. And you know
how queerly Martha acted while she was paying for
the ice-cream. She doesn&rsquo;t have much money, does
she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dorothy, reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how would she happen to have a new five-dollar
bill just like mine, all of a sudden? And why would she
act so embarrassed and queer about treating us to ice-cream?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Martha loves to treat,&rdquo; said Dorothy, a little lamely.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure she never took it,&rdquo; she added doggedly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t. Mrs. Halstead said she&rsquo;d make up
the loss to me, but we must not speak to Martha about it.
Of course I won&rsquo;t take five dollars from Mrs. Halstead,
but I promised I wouldn&rsquo;t tell Martha that she took it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very &lsquo;uppish&rsquo; to her, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who wouldn&rsquo;t be? That bill was on the table in
my bedroom, and Martha was in the room after I was.
And when I came home, it was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very careless to leave it on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t want to take it with me, so I
stuck it behind a picture that stands on the table. Nobody
would have seen it, but Martha knew it was there; she was
in the room when I put it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it blew off the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have, but I&rsquo;ve looked all over the room everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy sat silent. She hadn&rsquo;t wanted Martha to come,
but Betty had coaxed her into it, and this was the result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell Betty about
it, anyway. I know she&rsquo;ll think as I do, that Martha
couldn&rsquo;t have done such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t tell Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you will tell Betty, too!&rdquo; said a voice, and looking
up, the two girls saw Betty looking at them. The boat
had drifted near shore, and Betty beckoned to them to
come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you tell me what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; she said, as they
landed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be kept out of it any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Betty spoke like that, her comrades usually obeyed
her.</p>
<p>Half scared at Betty&rsquo;s frowning face, Maude told her
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What foolishness!&rdquo; said Betty, as she finished. &ldquo;Martha
could no more take a penny that didn&rsquo;t belong to her
than I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what made her act so flustered when she invited
us to have ice-cream and when she paid for it?&rdquo; demanded
Maude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where would she get a new five-dollar bill all of a
sudden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is my bill?&rdquo; wound up Maude, triumphantly,
and again Betty was forced to reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the same,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;Martha didn&rsquo;t take
it! And I&rsquo;ll prove it somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t prove it unless you find my bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll find your bill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve hunted everywhere for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>will</i> find it, and I&rsquo;ll make you take back all
you&rsquo;ve said about Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;d be glad to,&rdquo; said Maude, staring at Betty&rsquo;s
angry face; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to make her seem dishonest if
she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clear this matter up!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, &ldquo;and
then you&rsquo;ll feel sorry for what you&rsquo;ve said. And first I&rsquo;ll
go and tell Martha, and let her speak for herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t do that! Mrs. Halstead forbade us
to mention it to Martha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; then I&rsquo;ll take Martha and go straight to
Mrs. Halstead and let her tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t now, for Mrs. Halstead is superintending
the May-pole. The carpenters are putting it up, and she
asked us to keep away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got to do something! I can&rsquo;t rest till Martha
is cleared. Poor Martha! I don&rsquo;t see how anybody
could think such a thing of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty put her arm through Dorothy&rsquo;s, and they went on
ahead, leaving Maude to follow alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;we know Martha never has
spending-money. And for that to be a new bill that she
had yesterday does look queer. And she did act awfully
funny about it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Dorothy,&rdquo; said Betty, in a tone of despair;
&ldquo;I think it looks awfully queer. But I wouldn&rsquo;t own up
to Maude that I thought so. And, even if it does look
queer, I won&rsquo;t believe Martha took Maude&rsquo;s money unless
she tells me so herself&mdash;so there, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty had unconsciously raised her voice in her indignation,
and as they turned a corner of the path, they came
upon the other girls, sitting on a settee, waiting for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying, Betty?&rdquo; asked Martha, her face
perfectly white.</p>
<p>There was no blushing embarrassment now; Martha
looked horrified, and even incredulous, but she was calm
and self-possessed. Betty quite forgot what Maude had
said of Mrs. Halstead&rsquo;s orders, and spoke right out to
Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Martha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;did you see Maude take some
money out of her purse and lay it on her table yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take it from the table&mdash;to&mdash;to put it in a safer
place&mdash;or anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course I didn&rsquo;t! Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t a very safe place,&rdquo; began Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Maude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo; said Martha. &ldquo;What are
you talking about, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where did you get that new five-dollar bill you
spent yesterday?&rdquo; burst out Maude, unable to control her
tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Martha looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you&rsquo;ve been thinking that was
<i>your</i> money?&rdquo; she said, in a low, scared sort of voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; declared Maude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! I didn&rsquo;t, didn&rsquo;t! Betty, Betty, what <i>shall</i>
I do!&rdquo; and Martha burst into a fit of crying which nothing
could stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you see,&rdquo; said Betty, as she caressed her weeping
friend. &ldquo;Please all leave her to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others went away a little shamefacedly, while Betty
remained with Martha. She waited until the first bursts
of sobs were over, and then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Martha, brace up. I know and you know you
didn&rsquo;t take her old bill, but we&rsquo;ve got to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we prove it?&rdquo; asked Martha, between her
sobs, as she dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief. &ldquo;Oh,
Betty, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So shall I, if you act like this. Cheer up, I tell you,
and help me, and we&rsquo;ll fix this matter right yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How brave you are!&rdquo; said Martha, looking up at
Betty&rsquo;s determined face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s got to be, and you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Betty,
smiling. &ldquo;Now tell me everything you know about
Maude&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">BETTY FOUND BOBBY IN HIS NURSERY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything, except what she told you. I
was sitting by the table when she stuck it behind the picture.
I thought it was a funny place to put it, but I didn&rsquo;t
say so. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so careless with my bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get your bill, Martha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Fred gave it to me on Christmas. He said to
save it until I was sure I&rsquo;d thought of the thing I&rsquo;d like
best to buy with it. And I was <i>sure</i> I&rsquo;d rather treat you
all to ice-cream than to buy anything for myself. Oh,
Betty, I do love to be hospitable to people, and I never
have a chance! And when the chance really came, I was so
glad and so happy about it, that it made me rather fidgety
and embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear thing!&rdquo; cried Betty, kissing her. &ldquo;And
then to think of how they&rsquo;ve spoiled your little ice-cream
party! Well, go on; then did you stay in Maude&rsquo;s room
after she left it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a minute, to say good-by to little Bobby Halstead.
He was playing around there, and he&rsquo;s such a cunning
little chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bobby!</i> I&rsquo;ve an idea! Now you stay right here till
I come back! Don&rsquo;t you move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty flew into the house and went in search of four-year-old
Bobby. She found him in his nursery, mounted
upon his black hobby-horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, deary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you were in Maude&rsquo;s
room yesterday, did you see any money around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pennies?&rdquo; asked Bobby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, not pennies. Paper money. Green money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess, green paper, but not moneys. I cutted out a
paper dolly; see! It&rsquo;s not vewey good &rsquo;cause my sissiz was
dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bobby dived down into a box, and produced a queer-shaped
paper doll which was surely cut from a five-dollar
bill!</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s eyes danced, but she only said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find the green paper, deary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ve was&rsquo;e-bastick,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;I can always
have what&rsquo;s in ve was&rsquo;e-basticks. Muvver said I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course you can. That&rsquo;s all right. But lend
this dolly to Betty, won&rsquo;t you? Just for a little while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ess, I will,&rdquo; and the child gave it up willingly enough.</p>
<p>Back ran Betty with her prize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried, triumphantly waving the five-dollar
doll above her head. &ldquo;I told you Martha didn&rsquo;t
know anything about Maude&rsquo;s money. It must have blown
from the table into the waste-basket, and Bobby picked it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I do&mdash;remember!&rdquo; said Maude, slowly, &ldquo;the
waste-basket was upset when I came home! So I looked
through all the scraps carefully, but of course I didn&rsquo;t
find it. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Martha,&mdash;truly I am,&mdash;more
sorry than I can say! I don&rsquo;t suppose you can ever forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; said Martha, smiling through her
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to forgive you, too, Maude,&rdquo; said Betty;
&ldquo;but it will take me a little while. I am afraid it will be
half an hour before I can feel toward you as if you hadn&rsquo;t
done this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said Maude, contritely; &ldquo;but, Betty,
I didn&rsquo;t know Martha as you did, and it <i>did</i> look queer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; conceded Betty. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll get over
it in a <i>quarter</i> of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did, and when it was time for the May party, the
late unpleasantness was ignored by all, if not entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>Mr. Halstead gave Maude a five-dollar bill to replace
the one his son had spoiled, and he then also presented her
with the green paper doll, as a reminder not to trust too
much to appearances.</p>

<br />THE CHAPLET OF HONOR</h2>
<p>As soon as June had fairly dawned upon the calendar,
the girls of Miss Whittier&rsquo;s school began to
prepare for closing day.</p>
<p>It was customary to give an evening entertainment, in
which all the pupils took part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year,&rdquo; Miss Whittier announced to the class, &ldquo;I
have a very delightful plan, of which I will now tell you.
It is not exactly a play, but a little staged allegory which I
am sure you will all think very attractive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty listened eagerly, for &ldquo;staged allegory&rdquo; sounded
rather dry and poky, and yet it might turn out to be fun
after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo;&rdquo; whispered Dorothy,
who sat next her, and Betty&rsquo;s imagination immediately
saw all the girls with packs on their backs, climbing
the Hill of Difficulty. But Miss Whittier went on to
reveal her plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is called &lsquo;Honor Chaplet,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it
represents all the women who have done praiseworthy deeds
presenting their claims for the Chaplet of Honor, which is
to be awarded to the one who best merits it. Of course the
characters represent women of all time who have become
famous for great deeds or noble efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s head gave a nod of satisfaction. The whole plan
appealed to her, for it meant &ldquo;dressing up,&rdquo; and she dearly
loved to wear fancy costumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have a pretty stage,&rdquo; said Miss Whittier,
who on occasions like this talked sociably with her pupils,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure you will all be willing to help with the work
of decorating it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We will,&rdquo; said the girls, and then
Constance Harper asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the characters, Miss Whittier? Will you tell
us now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading from some papers she held, Miss Whittier
named about thirty celebrated women, including Cleopatra,
Queen Elizabeth, Pocahontas, Grace Darling,
Florence Nightingale, Isabella of Spain, Joan of Arc,
Queen Victoria, Barbara Frietchie, Rosa Bonheur, and
many others well known to history or tradition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you may each select the character
you prefer. If, by chance, two choose the same one,
we can easily adjust matters afterward. I will distribute
papers, and you may each write your own name, followed
by the character you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we&rsquo;re doing that, won&rsquo;t you tell us a little more
about the play, Miss Whittier?&rdquo; said Dorothy Bates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The plot, if it can be called a plot, is simple. One girl
must represent the Goddess of Honor. She will stand on
a pedestal, and hear the claims of the various celebrities.
She will wear a classic costume, and will have a chaplet
of bay to bestow on the successful one. She will be attended
by four allegorical figures, representing War and
Peace, Art and Wisdom. These girls will also wear classic
draperies, and look as much as possible like statues. The
other characters will, of course, wear costumes suited to
their personalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is there any dialogue?&rdquo; asked another pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; each character makes a short speech, setting
forth her claims to honor and glory. This seems a little
ostentatious,&rdquo; Miss Whittier smiled, &ldquo;but that is the way
the play is written. Then, finally, the Goddess awards
the chaplet to the one she deems most worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which one is that?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell that yet,&rdquo; said Miss Whittier, smiling;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not divulge that secret until you have all chosen your
parts, for, naturally, you would each desire the one who
will receive this crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed sensible to Betty, and she began to consider
what part she would like to take.</p>
<p>Miss Whittier had a full list of names written on the
blackboard, that all might see them, and Betty studied
them with care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>The four allegorical figures did not appeal to her at all.
It would be no fun to stand, perhaps on a pedestal, draped
about with Greek togas, or whatever statues wore, and not
even a red sash by way of coloring!</p>
<p>The Goddess of Honor was, of course, the most desirable,
and Betty almost decided to write that against her name.
But, she reflected, it was doubtful if Miss Whittier would
think her well suited for that. A goddess ought to be tall
and fair and statuesque, and Betty was anything but
that. Her round Irish face and somewhat tilted nose and
rosy cheeks were far from classic in type. And, anyhow,
probably some one else would choose that one who would
be much better fitted for the part. So Betty carefully
considered the other names. Pocahontas and Queen Elizabeth
both attracted her. She did not look particularly
like an Indian maiden, nor yet like an English queen, but
as she glanced around the room, she saw no one that looked
more so than she; at least, no one looked like Queen Elizabeth,
though some of the slim, straight-haired girls might
make a better Indian.</p>
<p>But, as she gazed, Betty decided that looks would not
have much to do with it. The girls must depend on their
costumes to represent the character they assumed.</p>
<p>And so Betty hesitated between the two she liked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Queen Elizabeth would be grand! In fancy, she saw
herself in a stiff, quilted satin petticoat, and long, heavy
train of crimson velvet, edged with ermine; a huge ruff
round her neck, and a gorgeous gilt crown! This would be
fine. Yet there was something very attractive about the
idea of Pocahontas; an Indian costume trimmed with gay
fringes and beads; leather leggings, and tall quill-feathers
sticking up round her head; a bow and arrow, perhaps,
and a quiver slung from one shoulder! Yes, it was enticing,
but the Queen&rsquo;s costume was grander and even more
enticing in color and glitter. So Betty wrote her own
name, and then wrote &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rdquo; below it, and
the papers were all gathered up.</p>
<p>Miss Whittier dismissed the girls then, and said she
would tell them definitely the next day what character
each should have, and, moreover, she asked them not to
tell any one about the entertainment, nor to tell each other
what r&ocirc;le they had chosen. So, as the girls were conscientious
in these matters, they did not tell each other
what parts they wished to take, but many and eager discussions
were held about the details of the great occasion.</p>
<p>Betty told her mother of the choice she had made, as the
pledge of secrecy did not include mothers.</p>
<p>Mrs. McGuire smiled at the idea of Betty robed as
Queen Elizabeth, but she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, you look quite as much like Elizabeth
as any of the other girls. And we&rsquo;ll fix up a fine costume
for you. I&rsquo;ll find a picture of the Queen in her most
gorgeous robes, and we&rsquo;ll have it copied as nearly as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>

<p class="center">BETTY WALKED ACROSS THE ROOM WITH STIFF, STAGY STRIDES</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I must have a lot of jewels!&rdquo; said Betty, clasping
her hands ecstatically at the thought of such grandeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire; &ldquo;you may wear my necklace,
and perhaps Grandma will lend you some large old-fashioned
brooches. I think we need not be so very particular
as to their being really of the Elizabethan period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; any glittery things will do. I think we ought
to try some necklaces of big imitation gems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall! At any rate, we&rsquo;ll copy the picture
as nearly as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be a gorgeous costume, won&rsquo;t it? Oh, I&rsquo;m
glad now I didn&rsquo;t choose Pocahontas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of speech do you have to make, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mother. Miss Whittier has them, all
type-written, and she will give them to us soon, she said.
But I&rsquo;ll not have any trouble to learn it. I can learn
things to recite so easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your memory is wonderful. And I suppose one
of the teachers will train you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in gestures and expression. Oh, Mother, won&rsquo;t it
be fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, girlie? I know it&rsquo;s just the sort of fun you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do; I&rsquo;ll walk like this.&rdquo; Catching up her
slumber-robe from the couch, Betty held it from her shoulders
like a court train, and walked across the room with
stiff, stagy strides, holding her head very high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, your Majesty, what are you doing?&rdquo; said Jack,
appearing at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Jack!&rdquo; cried Betty; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased that
you should have recognized what was meant for a queenly
gait. I&rsquo;m Queen Elizabeth of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! You look more like the White Queen of Looking-Glass
Land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I do now; but just you wait till I get
my velvet train and jeweled crown,&mdash;and, oh, Mother, shall
I have a scepter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think that&rsquo;s part of the costume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what fun!&rdquo; and seizing Jack, Betty waltzed
him about the room by way of expressing her glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Betty, go slower!&rdquo; he exclaimed breathlessly;
&ldquo;queens dance stately minuets&mdash;they don&rsquo;t dance break-downs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This queen does,&rdquo; said Betty, calmly, but she let Jack
go, on condition that he would help her hunt the library
for books containing pictures of the Queen.</p>
<p>Next day no mention was made of the entertainment
until after lessons were over. It was nearly time for dismissal
when Miss Whittier summoned the pupils to her in
the assembly-room.</p>
<p>She looked at them in a little perplexity, and then she
smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did not foresee the result,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I asked
you young ladies to choose your parts for our little play.
I thought that if two or even three should choose the same
character we could readily arrange matters by a little
friendly discussion. But, to my surprise, when the papers
were looked over, this was the result: twelve girls have
chosen the Goddess of Honor; nine have selected Pocahontas;
seven want Queen Elizabeth, and the others are scattering.
Now, as you can readily see, this state of affairs
requires arbitration. So I am obliged to tell you that we
must disregard your wishes, and assign the parts as we,
the teachers, think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed heartily when they realized how many
of their number had asked for the most desirable part,
that of Goddess of Honor, and they agreed that, after all,
the fairest way was for the teachers to assign the parts,
and then there could be no preference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; went on Miss Whittier, &ldquo;I have prepared full
directions for each of you. Here are the envelopes for you
all, and in your envelope you will each find the name of the
character you are to take, with full description of costume,
and a copy of the lines you are to learn to recite in the
play. And please remember the appointments are final and
unalterable.&rdquo; The envelopes were distributed, and each
girl looked eagerly inside to see what her part might be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are dismissed,&rdquo; said Miss Whittier. &ldquo;There is
no further occasion for secrecy, though I&rsquo;m sure it will be
better for the success of our entertainment not to tell your
friends who will be in the audience much about it beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Betty?&rdquo; said Dorothy, as, with
Jeanette, they all started homeward. &ldquo;You look as if
you&rsquo;d lost your last friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And truly Betty did look woebegone. Her cheeks were
flushed with anger, her lips were drawn in a tight line, and
her eyes already showed hints of flooding with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; she exclaimed tragically, as she held
out her paper toward the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Grace Darling!&rsquo;&rdquo; read Dorothy. &ldquo;Oh, Betty, you
don&rsquo;t like your part, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like it!&rdquo; cried Betty; &ldquo;read what the costume is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Simple sailor suit,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Dorothy, &ldquo;&lsquo;of dark-blue
flannel, small yachting-cap, or no hat at all. Carry an
oar.&rsquo; Why, that&rsquo;s a sweet little costume, Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet little nothing!&rdquo; cried Betty, stormily. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to wear a common, every-day sailor suit! And
carry an oar! Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you want?&rdquo; asked Jeanette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to be a goddess,&rdquo; said Betty, honestly. &ldquo;But
I didn&rsquo;t write that, &rsquo;cause I was &rsquo;most sure Miss Whittier
would rather have a yellow-haired girl for that. So I
chose Queen Elizabeth, but I&rsquo;d have been satisfied with
Pocahontas. But Grace Darling! Oh, I think it&rsquo;s mean!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Grace Darling was very noble and heroic,&rdquo; said
Jeanette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. Grace Darling herself was wonderful.
I just adore her! But I want to wear a pretty costume in
the play&mdash;a grand one, you know, like a queen or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Dorothy, sympathetically, for she
well knew Betty&rsquo;s love of bright colors and gay &ldquo;dressing
up.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a shame, too. Maybe Miss Whittier
will let you change with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she said we positively couldn&rsquo;t change our parts.
And, anyhow, I wouldn&rsquo;t take yours if it&rsquo;s nicer than mine.
What is yours, Dot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queen Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Dorothy, feeling as mean as if
she had been caught in a wrong action.</p>
<p>Betty had to smile at Dorothy&rsquo;s contrite tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you&rsquo;d have it than any
one else. Mother&rsquo;ll lend you her necklace, I know. What&rsquo;s
yours, Jeanette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan of Arc, and just the one I wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you got it. But,
oh, girls, I wish I had a pretty one. If I&rsquo;d only had Priscilla
or Cleopatra, or anybody that wore pretty things!
But &lsquo;a simple sailor suit!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too mean for anything!&rdquo; declared Dorothy; &ldquo;it
takes the fun out of the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; it isn&rsquo;t so bad as that,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling
through her gathering tears. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll get over my
disappointment. And I&rsquo;m silly to care so much, anyhow.
What&rsquo;s Constance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the Goddess,&rdquo; said Dorothy, reluctantly, for
this seemed to add another straw to Betty&rsquo;s burden of
woe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; said Betty, generously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be a
lovely goddess, she&rsquo;s so pretty and graceful. Well, let me
help you girls with your costumes, as long as I haven&rsquo;t
any of my own to fuss over. I can get an inexpensive,
&lsquo;simple sailor suit&rsquo; ready-made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty turned in at her own gate, and after their good-bys
the other girls went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just horrid,&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;I know how bad
Betty feels about it, and I&rsquo;m going to ask Miss Whittier to
change it somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Jeanette; &ldquo;I wish she would,
but I know she&rsquo;ll say if she changes one she&rsquo;ll have to
change others, and it&rsquo;ll be a regular mix-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s just what Miss Whittier did say, though in
different words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; she said kindly, but decidedly, when
Dorothy told her about it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Betty is disappointed,
but several of the girls have already asked to
change their parts, and I&rsquo;ve been obliged to say &lsquo;no&rsquo; to
each; so of course I can&rsquo;t make an exception in favor of
Betty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>This settled it, and Betty accepted her fate, outwardly
with a good grace, but secretly with a rebellious
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a mistake,&rdquo; she said to her mother, &ldquo;for girls
like Kate Alden and May Jennings would <i>like</i> to have only
simple costumes to prepare. And they have to rig up as
Martha Washington and Mary, Queen of Scots! Either of
them would rather have Grace Darling, and only have to
get a &lsquo;simple sailor suit!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> too bad, Betty dear,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just
as sorry as I can be. But I can&rsquo;t see any help for it, so
we must submit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I know it, and I&rsquo;m not going to growl about it
any more. But it does make me mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty kicked a footstool, as if to relieve her overburdened
feelings, and then laughed at herself for her foolishness.</p>
<p>She learned her lines carefully, determined to do her
part as well as she could, if her dress was plain and inconspicuous.</p>
<p>Her speech was full of brave and noble thoughts, and
Betty practised it often, and observed conscientiously her
teacher&rsquo;s instructions as to inflections and gestures. It
was easy for Betty to learn by heart; so easy, indeed, that
she unconsciously learned most of the other girls&rsquo; speeches
by merely hearing them at rehearsals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Often she would amuse her mother and Jack by breaking
forth into some of the stilted lines of the play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Pocahontas,&rdquo; she would say, striking an attitude
of what she considered Indian effect; &ldquo;I claim the prize,
Goddess, because I, in years that are past, rendered a
service&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, that will do, Betty!&rdquo; Jack would cry.
&ldquo;You are a born actress, I know, but I&rsquo;m studying my
English history now, and Pocahontas doesn&rsquo;t belong with
the Saxon kings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, English history!&rdquo; said Betty, mischievously.</p>
<p>Then, stalking grandly up to him, she held an umbrella
for a scepter, and declaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goddess of Honor! You see before you Elizabeth, the
Virgin Queen. A noble monarch, not alone in power, but
in majestic traits that won for her the loyalty and adoration
of her loved and loving subjects. A queen who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with her head!&rdquo; cried Jack, throwing a sofa-pillow
at Betty, who promptly threw it back at him, and then
ran laughing from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>It was not Betty&rsquo;s way to mourn over what couldn&rsquo;t be
helped, so she went cheerfully with her mother to purchase
the despised sailor suit. They bought the prettiest one
they could find&mdash;a blue serge with white collar and cuffs
and a silk sailor tie. But though it was becoming and
would have looked just right had Betty been starting on a
yachting cruise, it was not to be compared with the elaborate
costumes most of the girls were preparing. And,
though it was cold comfort, Betty was true to her word, and
helped the others all she could to make their gowns effective.
She lent her Roman sash, her embroidered Japanese
kimono, and her spangled Egyptian scarf to girls who
could use them effectively. She helped Dorothy with her
Elizabethan garb, and Jeanette with her Joan of Arc costume.</p>
<p>As for the Goddess, Constance had a most resplendent
robe. It was of soft white shimmering stuff dotted all
over with gilt spangles. Billows of this material fell from
her shoulders in long, graceful folds, and swept away in
a rippling train. A high crown of golden filigree-work was
to be worn on her beautiful, fair hair, and while in one
hand she was to hold a classic scroll, in the other she was
to carry aloft a long, slender, gilt trumpet. The costume
was superb, and almost took Betty&rsquo;s breath away when she
first saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Constance,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;let me try it on, do! Just
for a minute! I&rsquo;ll be awfully careful of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constance agreed, of course, though she secretly feared
that impetuous Betty might tear the gauzy stuff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>But Betty donned it almost reverently, and then, imitating
Constance&rsquo;s pose, as she had seen her at rehearsal,
she began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Goddess of Honor I! To those who seek me I
am hard to win. To those who nobly and unflinchingly
do their bravest and best, I come unsummoned! I am
here to-night, bearing the Chaplet of Honor, the award of
Fame. To whom shall I award it? Who best deserves the
greatest guerdon, the highest honor Fame can bestow?
Speak, noble women of all time, speak, and claim your
due!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So often had Betty heard Constance declaim these ringing
lines at rehearsal that she knew them as well as her
own, and so inspired was she by the beautiful raiment she
had on that her oratory was quite in spirit with the character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Betty!&rdquo; said Constance, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know you could recite so well. Try your own speech now;
it&rsquo;s a good chance to rehearse. But get out of that
gown first. I&rsquo;m terribly afraid you&rsquo;ll catch it on something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Betty, stepping gingerly out of the
glistening mass as it fell about her feet. &ldquo;Now listen to
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>She recited the lines Grace Darling was supposed to
speak, and so earnestly did she tell of the noble work she
had done in saving life that it seemed as if the most stony-hearted
of goddesses must be moved to award her the Chaplet
of Honor.</p>
<p>It was not known even yet who should receive the wreath.
Each girl was expected to do her best, and after all had
taken part, the Goddess would make the award. Of course
it was arranged beforehand who should have it, but, as this
was not known, each secretly hoped for it.</p>
<p>At last the day of the great event arrived.</p>
<p>The entertainment would begin at eight o&rsquo;clock, but the
girls were requested to be at the school at half-past seven.</p>
<p>Some of them dressed at home and came all ready for
the stage, but those who had more elaborate or eccentric
costumes brought them with them and dressed at the school.
Betty dressed at home, for her sailor suit could easily be
worn under a light coat. She went with a heavy heart, for,
though she had scolded herself for being a silly, and had
forced herself to make believe she didn&rsquo;t mind, yet when
the evening arrived, and she saw many of the other girls in
glittering, fanciful dresses, she felt again the bitter disappointment
of her plain little frock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Betty girl,&rdquo; said her mother, as they separated,
Betty to go to the school-room and Mrs. McGuire to
the audience-room, &ldquo;you must make your success by your
own work to-night. The others may have beautiful trappings,
but you must win out by your really good work in
declamation. Win the hearts of the audience by your pathetic
story of Grace Darling&rsquo;s work, and you may represent
the part better than those who have elaborate costumes
do theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>Betty smiled, knowing her mother&rsquo;s advice was good, and
yet unable to repress a little feeling of envy as she saw the
resplendent figures all around her. But she could and did
help showing it.</p>
<p>She went about among the girls, helping one or another
to adjust her adornments, or prompting some one who was
frantically rehearsing her lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prompt any of you, if you need it,&rdquo; said Betty,
laughing, &ldquo;for I do believe I know every line of this whole
play. I didn&rsquo;t try to learn it, but I&rsquo;ve heard it so often, it
sticks in my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">At eight o&rsquo;clock Miss Whittier marshaled them in order
to go on the stage. Of course the curtain was still down, as
the Goddess had not yet taken her place, but after its rising
the others were to enter one by one and address themselves
to the arbiter of their fates. They waited, almost
breathlessly, in the hush that always comes before the lifting
of a curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Constance Harper?&rdquo; asked Miss Whittier, in
a whisper, of another teacher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I supposed, of course,
she was here. She said she&rsquo;d dress at home, as her robe is
so frail, and that she&rsquo;d be here, all ready to go on the stage,
at quarter to eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; thought Betty, &ldquo;Constance is nearly always
late, but I thought she&rsquo;d be on time to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, at such entertainments, no one is greatly
surprised if the performance is a little delayed, but
the absence of Constance seemed ominous to Miss Whittier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better send for her,&rdquo; she began, when a
man came in, in breathless haste. He carried a large white
box, and, going straight to Miss Whittier, he said rapidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Constance, ma&rsquo;am, she sprained her ankle&mdash;just
now. She slipped coming down-stairs, and she can&rsquo;t walk
nohow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprained her ankle!&rdquo; cried Miss Whittier. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
she be here to-night? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Mrs. Harper&rsquo;s coachman, ma&rsquo;am; and Miss Constance
she was all dressed in her angel clothes and all, and
jest goin&rsquo; to get in the kerridge, when she slipped on the
shiny stair, and her high-heeled slipper twisted somehow,
and she jest sprained her ankle. So Mrs. Harper, soon&rsquo;s
she could, she got the party clo&rsquo;es offen her, and she&rsquo;s sent
them to you, &rsquo;cause she says somebody else&rsquo;ll have to do
Miss Constance&rsquo;s piece to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Miss Whittier, clasping her hands. &ldquo;What
can we do? But we must do something quickly. Lena
Carey, you&rsquo;re about Constance&rsquo;s size; can&rsquo;t you take the
part of Goddess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d love to, Miss Whittier,&rdquo; said Lena, looking
longingly at the spangled white mass in the box, which
had just been opened, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know a word of her
lines. It&rsquo;s all I can do to remember my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do!&rdquo; cried Miss Whittier, in despair.
&ldquo;Does anybody know the Goddess&rsquo;s part? Oh, why didn&rsquo;t
I think to have an understudy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty hesitated. It seemed presumptuous for her to
offer, for she well knew she didn&rsquo;t look like Miss Whittier&rsquo;s
idea of a Goddess of Honor. But no one else volunteered,
so she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Whittier, I don&rsquo;t look right, I know, but I know
every one of Constance&rsquo;s lines perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You blessed child!&rdquo; cried Miss Whittier; &ldquo;do you
really? Are you sure, Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer, Betty began rapidly, and with no attempt
at dramatic effect:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Goddess of Honor I! To those who seek me I
am hard to win. To those who nobly and unflinchingly&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do!&rdquo; said Miss Whittier, smiling in
spite of her anxiety. &ldquo;Get out of that sailor suit, Betty,
just as quick as you can, and get into Constance&rsquo;s
things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Betty, her voice thrilling with intense
excitement, &ldquo;yes, Miss Whittier. I&rsquo;ve been in them before,
and I know just how they go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several deft pairs of hands gave assistance; Miss Whittier
herself gathered up Betty&rsquo;s loose curls into a classic
knot, and so well did she arrange it that, when the gilt
crown was in place, the whole effect was harmonious, and
Betty&rsquo;s sparkling eyes lit up a face that any goddess might
be pleased to own.</p>
<p>Mindful of Constance&rsquo;s injunctions about tearing the
delicate fabric, Betty gathered up her train and followed
Miss Whittier to the stage.</p>
<p>As she passed, Dorothy took opportunity to whisper,
&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad&rdquo;; and Jeanette gave her a loving pat
as she went by.</p>
<p>The stage was draped entirely with white cheese-cloth,
thickly sprinkled with gilt paper stars. A large pedestal
stood ready for the Goddess, and on either side were two
lower pedestals, occupied by her allegorical attendants, who,
already in place, were wondering what had happened to the
Goddess they were to serve.</p>
<p>Betty needed no instructions. She knew every pose
Constance had been taught to take, as well as the lines
themselves. Poising herself gracefully, she lifted her outstretched
arm, with the long, slender trumpet, and placed
the mouthpiece to her lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo; whispered Miss Whittier, delighted at
Betty&rsquo;s artistic, yet natural, pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Miss Whittier,&rdquo; Betty whispered back;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear child! You&rsquo;ve saved the day for us all. I
know you&rsquo;ll do it with credit to us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Miss Whittier went in front of the curtain, and in
a few words told of Constance&rsquo;s accident, and explained
that her part would be taken by Miss Elizabeth McGuire,
for whom she begged indulgence if not perfect in her part.</p>
<p>Betty, behind the curtain, heard the applause, and thinking
how surprised Jack and her mother would be, she stood
motionless as the curtain rose.</p>
<p>Another storm of applause broke forth at the beautiful
picture, and when it subsided, Betty, with just the least
tremor of excitement in her voice, began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Goddess of Honor I! To those who seek me I am
hard to win. To those who nobly and unflinchingly do
their bravest and best, I come unsummoned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech was not of great literary value; those in
amateur entertainments rarely are; but Betty was a good
elocutionist and full of dramatic instinct. Moreover, her
sudden change from an inconspicuous figure to the chief
one of all put her on her mettle, and she fairly outdid
herself in rendering the opening speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic14">

<p class="center">THE GODDESS OF HONOR PLACED THE CHAPLET ON THE BOWED HEAD OF ISABELLA OF SPAIN</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The play went on beautifully. Not once did Betty falter,
or forget a line. The others, too, all did their parts
well, and when, at last, the Goddess of Honor placed the
chaplet on the bowed head of Isabella of Spain, the picture
was a beautiful one, and the house fairly rose in applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t feel sorry for Constance,&rdquo; said
Betty, to her mother, as they drove home. &ldquo;I did, and I
do, feel <i>truly</i> sorry. But when she couldn&rsquo;t be there, and
Miss Whittier <i>had</i> to have somebody, I was so glad I knew
the part and could take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me, dear,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;I know
too well my Betty&rsquo;s generous heart to think for a moment
that you rejoiced at Constance&rsquo;s accident. But I, too, am
glad that, since poor Constance couldn&rsquo;t be there, my little
girl could be of such help to Miss Whittier, and could, all
unexpectedly, succeed so well in what was really a difficult
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a trump, Betty,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m glad
you had the chance. I&rsquo;m downright sorry for Connie, but
I&rsquo;m jolly glad for you!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">IX</span>
<br />AN INDEPENDENCE DAY RECEPTION</h2>
<p>Toward the latter part of June the McGuire family
migrated to Denniston for the summer. The beautiful
country place, on the outskirts of the little town of
Greenborough, was looking its prettiest as they arrived one
lovely afternoon and took possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways I&rsquo;m glad to be back here,&rdquo; said Betty,
as they sat on the veranda after supper, &ldquo;and in some
ways I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with &rsquo;most everything,&rdquo; commented
Jack, philosophically; &ldquo;there are always some good sides
and some bad sides to whatever we do. I love Denniston,
but there&rsquo;s more to do in Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more people,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Jack; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always noticed there <i>are</i>
more people in a large city than in a small village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty threw a hammock pillow at him, and went on:
&ldquo;I mean more people that I like to be with. I shall miss
Dorothy and Jeanette awfully down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might invite them to visit you,&rdquo; suggested her
mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I would; but it&rsquo;s rather dull here. There&rsquo;s nothing
special for them to do, you see; they usually go to watering-places
in the summer, and I doubt if they&rsquo;d want to
come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, Betty!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d like to come,
just to see you. And Denniston Hall is a lovely place. A
flock of girls ought to be able to make fun for themselves
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;anyhow, I&rsquo;ll ask them, and if
they don&rsquo;t want to come, they can decline. I&rsquo;ll ask Constance
too, and perhaps Lena&mdash;that is, if you are willing,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;Make it a little house-party.
With picnics and drives you can make it pleasant for them,
I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Agnes Graham and her brother Stub came
strolling up the driveway, and heartily welcomed the
Denniston people back to their summer home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time,&rdquo; said Agnes, as the young people
grouped themselves in the wicker chairs on the veranda or
in the swinging settee; &ldquo;have you heard about the Library
Benefit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, somebody&rsquo;s going to give a whole lot of money
for a town library, if the town will raise another whole
lot of money itself. And so everybody in Greenborough is
planning to do something to help. And we thought, that
is, we hoped, you&rsquo;d join with the Dorcas Club, and help
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;but tell me more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the truth is, Betty, the girls of the Dorcas Club
haven&rsquo;t really made any definite plans, and they want you
to suggest something&mdash;only they&rsquo;re afraid to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid to ask me!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they think you&rsquo;re so haughty and stuck-up since
you&rsquo;ve lived in Boston that they&rsquo;re afraid you won&rsquo;t want
to work with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes Graham, you ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Have you ever known me to act a bit haughty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t. But the other girls don&rsquo;t know you
as well as I do, and they say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! May Fordham and Tilly Fenn know me quite
as well as you do; do they say I&rsquo;m haughty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, May and Tilly don&rsquo;t&mdash;at least, I&rsquo;ve never heard
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who does, then? You may as well tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s drop the subject!&rdquo; said Stub, who hated a
fuss. &ldquo;What do you girls want to gossip for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; put in Jack; &ldquo;if people say she&rsquo;s
haughty, when she <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>, she ought to know who says it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nobody in particular,&rdquo; said Agnes, alarmed at
the excitement she had caused. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re nice to them,
Betty, they&rsquo;ll stop saying it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s nice to them!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, indignantly.
&ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s always nice to everybody, Agnes Graham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can stand up for myself,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing at
Jack&rsquo;s emphatic speech. &ldquo;Go on, Agnes, and tell me what
they want me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what they want is for you to let them have a
sort of a garden-party here at Denniston, and charge admission,
you know, and let all the club take part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought of having a garden-party myself,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;a sort of home-coming to Denniston, you know.
I don&rsquo;t see why we couldn&rsquo;t combine the two, and so make
some money for your Library Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be fine!&rdquo; said Agnes. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
they want,&mdash;to have the affair here, you know,&mdash;but they
thought you wouldn&rsquo;t be willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I won&rsquo;t be willing unless you tell me who it is
that says things about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that, Betty; it isn&rsquo;t fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps it isn&rsquo;t. Never mind; I shall soon find
it out for myself. Now let&rsquo;s plan the garden-party. When
shall we have it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it on Fourth of July,&rdquo; suggested Jack.
&ldquo;Then we can combine patriotism and charity and fun and
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Mrs. McGuire approved the plan, and agreed to help in
any way she could.</p>
<p>So the very next day Betty went to a meeting of the
Dorcas Club, and was made a member of it. The girls
all seemed glad to welcome Betty, and were delighted at the
prospect of a garden-party at Denniston on the Fourth of
July. The club was a good-sized one, numbering about
thirty girls in all, and they at once began to appoint committees,
and so divide the work to be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have everything red, white, and blue,&rdquo; said May
Fordham, &ldquo;and flags everywhere. Oh, it will be beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie Hale was president of the club, and it was only a
short time before Betty discovered that it was Susie who
was not entirely in sympathy with the plan proposed.
Betty was amused rather than annoyed at Susie&rsquo;s attitude,
for of course Susie had no real reason to dislike Betty, or to
consider her proud or haughty.</p>
<p>It was really a sort of envy or jealousy that Susie felt,
and this seemed to manifest itself in sly innuendoes or
mean little acts, for which there is always opportunity in a
girls&rsquo; club.</p>
<p>At the second meeting Betty was made chairman of the
general committee, and as this was practically giving her
entire charge of the whole affair, it made Susie&rsquo;s position
as president of the club a secondary office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>However, as the F&ecirc;te was to be held at Betty&rsquo;s home, it
was only right that she should be the principal in the
management of it, and most of the girls were quite content
to have it so.</p>
<p>Betty had invited four girls from Boston, and Dorothy,
Jeanette, Constance, and Lena arrived a few days before
the Fourth, quite ready to take part in the festivities.</p>
<p>The Van Courts, too, who were one of the principal
families of Greenborough, had agreed to lend all the assistance
they could, and so the garden-party bade fair to be
a great success. It was called an &ldquo;Independence Day
Reception,&rdquo; and the tickets were prettily printed in red and
blue on white cards, and had tiny flags in the corner. They
read thus:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center">COLUMBIA AND UNCLE SAM
<br />AT HOME
<br />AT DENNISTON HALL
<br />JULY FOURTH
<br />AT THREE O&rsquo;CLOCK</p>
</div>
<p>Remembering Constance&rsquo;s disappointment in not being
able to take her part at the school commencement, Betty
resolved to make it up to her on this occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>So, though the club girls insisted that Betty herself
should take the part of Columbia, she positively refused to
do so, and proposed that Constance Harper should personate
the Goddess of Liberty.</p>
<p>This arrangement suited Susie Hale, who didn&rsquo;t want
Betty to have the admiration and applause that would, of
course, be given to Columbia as hostess of the entertainment.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Van Court consented to take the part of
Uncle Sam, and thus the principal figures were arranged.</p>
<p>The girls of the club were to wear whatever costumes
they chose.</p>
<p>A grand march was to be made first, in which different
countries were to be represented.</p>
<p>Betty chose Ireland, and had a lovely green costume made
for the occasion. The boys of Greenborough were invited
to participate also, and the characters of John Bull, a
French marquis, a Spanish troubadour, a Swiss peasant, an
Italian, a Chinaman, and other nationalities were chosen
by some of the boys and girls. Others were to be in
attendance at the various booths, or to act as waiters in the
refreshment tent.</p>
<p>When the Fourth of July arrived, all of the Denniston
household were astir at daybreak, for there was much
to be done that could not be done until the day of the
fair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>By midday, however, the place was nearly ready. Pat
had worked steadily, and so had all the other servants, as
well as the family and the guests. The beautiful grounds
of Denniston were gay with decorations.</p>
<p>Flags waved everywhere; bunting was draped, and
Japanese lanterns swung from every available point. Big
white transparencies, which would be illuminated in the
evening, bore the national dates, or announced the goods
for sale at the various booths.</p>
<p>The house, too, was decked with flags and lanterns, and
the spacious veranda was filled with chairs, where guests
might linger to listen to the music.</p>
<p>The band-stand was near by, and a fine orchestra had
been engaged to play patriotic airs.</p>
<p>Booths were all about the grounds.</p>
<p>The largest was the main refreshment tent, where dainty
little tables were set forth, with Japanese paper table-cloths
and napkins all bearing our own national emblems.</p>
<p>The waitresses here were thirteen girls who represented
the thirteen original States. They wore white dresses and
tricolor sashes and caps, with the name of their States in
gilt letters. Another booth held all sorts of small articles
for sale&mdash;fancy-work, from sofa-pillows to needle-books, all
made of red, white, and blue silks; photograph frames
made of silk flags; dolls dressed in red, white, and blue;
scrap-books made of linen of the same colors, and filled
with patriotic pictures and verses. Even such prosaic
things as dusters and sweeping-caps were of the three colors
and found a ready sale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Another booth had flags, fire-works, and Fourth of July
badges for sale. The lemonade, in accordance with time-honored
tradition, was served by &ldquo;Rebecca at the Well.&rdquo;
The well had been prettily built by a carpenter in imitation
of &ldquo;The Old Oaken Bucket,&rdquo; and as Rebecca wore the
American colors, the dramatic unities were somewhat lost,
but nobody minded, as the lemonade was ice-cold and very
good. An Indian wigwam was a gay feature. Jack had
this in charge, and had superintended the building of it
himself.</p>
<p>A tribe of ferocious-looking Indian braves, much
befeathered and painted, sold Indian curios, baskets, and
beads.</p>
<p>The tennis-courts, bowling-alleys, and croquet-grounds
were in order, and patrons could indulge in these games by
payment of a small fee.</p>
<p>Inside the house, too, entertainment was provided.</p>
<p>Various indoor games were offered, and there was also
a reading-room, with magazines and books for all. In
another room was shown an &ldquo;Historic Loan Collection.&rdquo;
Many of the residents of Greenborough had relics of
Revolutionary days, which they loaned for this occasion.
As there were many really interesting and valuable specimens,
the visitors were quite willing to pay the extra fee
required to see them, and the room was well-filled with
patrons much of the time. Opposite this room, in another
room, was a &ldquo;Burlesque Loan Collection,&rdquo; and this
attracted quite as much attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Stub Graham had this in charge, and he deserved credit
for the clever and humorous jokes he devised.</p>
<p>Catalogues had been prepared, and as an inducement to
buy them, a large placard outside the door announced that
each purchaser of a catalogue would receive, free of charge,
a steel-engraving of George Washington. When these
premiums proved to be two-cent postage-stamps, and canceled
ones at that, much merriment ensued.</p>
<p>Among the so-called Revolutionary relics were such jests
as these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early Home of George Washington,&rdquo; represented by
an old-fashioned cradle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vision of Washington&rsquo;s Old Age:&rdquo; a pair of spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington&rsquo;s Reflections&rdquo; was a small portrait of
Washington arranged so that it was reflected in a triplicate
mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Most Brilliant Lights of the Washington Era&rdquo;
were a few lighted candles. &ldquo;The Lone Picket&rdquo; was a
single fence-picket. &ldquo;The Tax on Tea&rdquo; showed a few
carpet-tacks on some tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Little Indian&rdquo; was a small portion of Indian meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An Old-Time Fancy Ball&rdquo; was a child&rsquo;s gay-colored
worsted ball, much torn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington at One Hundred Years of Age&rdquo; was a
bird&rsquo;s-eye map of the city of Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away down on the Suwanee River&rdquo; was a map of
Georgia showing plainly the Suwanee River, on which was
pasted a tiny bit of down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Last of the Army&rdquo; was simply the letter Y.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Member of Washington&rsquo;s Cabinet&rdquo; was an old brass
handle from a mahogany cabinet.</p>
<p>These and many other such quips made up an exhibition
that amused people quite as much as the display of real
relics edified them.</p>
<p>The preparation of all these features meant a great deal
of hard work, but it was the sort of work made light by
many hands, and so it was enjoyed by all who engaged
in it.</p>
<p>And so, by midday on the Fourth of July, everything
was in readiness, and the willing workers went to their
homes, to return later, ready to reap the results of their
labors.</p>
<p>The grand march was to take place at three o&rsquo;clock, and
Columbia and Uncle Sam were to review it from their
stand on the veranda. This was to be followed by the
singing of the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; accompanied by
the orchestra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>It had been arranged that Betty should sing the verses
as a solo, and that all the others, and indeed all the
audience, should join in the chorus. Betty had not cared
specially about singing, but had good-naturedly agreed to
do so when the music committee asked her to.</p>
<p>Her voice had improved by reason of her singing lessons
in Boston, and after practising the national anthem with
her mother, she felt that she could manage its high notes
successfully.</p>
<p>It seemed a little incongruous for a girl in a green
costume and carrying the harp of Erin to sing the American
song, but Betty was of New England parentage as well as
Irish, and she was glad to show her double patriotism.
Constance was greatly pleased at her r&ocirc;le of Columbia, and
her costume was beautiful. Very becoming, as well, was
the striped red and white skirt, and the blue bodice spangled
with stars. A liberty-cap, and a large well-made shield on
which to lean, added to the picturesque effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Dick Van Court was a humorous figure in his
&ldquo;Uncle Sam&rdquo; suit. He looked just as the Uncle Sam of
the cartoons always looks, and as he was a tall, thin young
man, the character suited him well. A white beaver hat
and the long, sparse locks of hair and white goatee were all
in evidence, so that Mr. Dick&rsquo;s costume was pronounced a
success by all the visitors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock Betty went to her room to dress.
She had been busy every minute of the day, had scarcely
taken time to eat her luncheon, but now everything was in
readiness, and she had only to dress and take her place
in the grand march at three o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Slipping on a kimono, she threw herself down on a couch
for a moment&rsquo;s rest before dressing. It was perhaps half
an hour later when Constance presented herself at the
door of Betty&rsquo;s room, ready for inspection of her pretty
costume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; she called, as she tapped at Betty&rsquo;s
closed door.</p>
<p>Getting no reply, she tapped again, but after two or three
unanswered calls she concluded Betty had gone down-stairs,
and so she went down herself.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t see Betty, but Mr. Van Court was there, in the
full glory of his &ldquo;regimentals,&rdquo; and the two, as it was
not quite time to take their position, strolled about the
veranda, looking out upon the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like fairy-land,&rdquo; said Constance, &ldquo;and to-night,
when the lanterns are lighted, it will be still more so.
Oh, here comes the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orchestra, in resplendent uniforms, took their places
on the band-stand, and began their preliminary tuning of
instruments.</p>
<p>Then the girls and boys began to arrive, and each
costume was greeted with admiring applause.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic15">
<img src="images/i224.jpg" alt="&ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S BETTY?&rdquo; SAID JACK, WRAPPED IN HIS INDIAN BLANKET" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="center">&ldquo;WHERE&rsquo;S BETTY?&rdquo; SAID JACK, WRAPPED IN HIS INDIAN BLANKET</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo; said Dorothy, as she came down,
dressed as a dear little Swiss peasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Constance; &ldquo;she must be out
in the grounds somewhere. She wasn&rsquo;t in her room when I
came down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s time she appeared,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ten
minutes of three now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo; said Jack, as, wrapped in his Indian
blanket, he came suddenly up to the girls, looking somewhat
worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; they replied at the same time. &ldquo;She
must be around somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she is,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but she isn&rsquo;t dressed for the
grand march yet. I&rsquo;ve just been to her room, and her
green dress is all spread out on the bed, and she&rsquo;s nowhere
to be found. Mother doesn&rsquo;t know where she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how strange!&rdquo; said Constance. &ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s never
late, and it was about two when we both went up-stairs
to dress. Where can she be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There didn&rsquo;t seem any real reason for alarm, but it
was certainly strange that Betty should disappear so
mysteriously. As Constance said, Betty was never late.
She was always ready at the appointed time, and it seemed
as if something must have happened to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find Betty anywhere,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, as
she joined the disturbed-looking group. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so strange,
for I know she had nothing more to attend to. She stopped
at my door about two o&rsquo;clock, and said everything was ready
and she was going to dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was beginning to look serious now, and Dorothy went
back to Betty&rsquo;s room to make search.</p>
<p>As Jack had said, her pretty green dress was spread out
in readiness. The little green slippers stood near by, and
the green cap and gilt harp lay on the couch. Surely Betty
had not begun to dress. She must have been called away
by some one suddenly. Her kimono was flung across a
chair as if hurriedly thrown there, and Dorothy looked in
the dress-cupboard to see what Betty might be wearing.
But there were many suits and dresses hanging there, and
Dorothy couldn&rsquo;t tell which, if any, pretty summer costume
was missing. It was very mysterious, and she went slowly
down-stairs again, wondering what they should do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been kidnapped,&rdquo; Mrs. McGuire was saying;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always feared it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said Mrs. Van Court, an elderly lady, who
was Mr. Dick&rsquo;s mother. &ldquo;Of course she hasn&rsquo;t been
kidnapped. I think she has fallen in the pond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs. Van Court,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Betty is too big
a girl to tumble into the water. I think some one on some
committee wanted her to look after some booth or something,
and she&rsquo;s about the place somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; said Dick Van Court, &ldquo;but if I
know Betty, she&rsquo;d attend to the matter and be back in time
for the march at three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s after three now,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;Whatever can
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody knew just what to do. It didn&rsquo;t seem possible
that anything unfortunate had occurred, and yet what else
could be keeping Betty away, wherever she was?</p>
<p>Meanwhile what had become of Betty?</p>
<p>Well, it was just this:</p>
<p>While she was in her own room, just about to dress in
her green suit, a note was brought to her by one of the
servants.</p>
<p>The note read thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Deer Bety</span>: Susie isent going to the Forth a July
Party atall. She&rsquo;s mad at you.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Jennie Hale.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jennie Hale was Susie&rsquo;s younger sister, and Betty saw
at once that she had written this note without Susie&rsquo;s
knowledge.</p>
<p>But for Susie, the president of the club, to stay away
from the garden-party would be a catastrophe indeed!
Betty would be censured for making trouble, and Susie&rsquo;s
friends would say all sorts of things. It was hard on Betty.
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
She had truly tried to make friends with Susie, and
thought she had overcome the girl&rsquo;s silly jealousy. What
especial thing Susie was &ldquo;mad at&rdquo; now, Betty didn&rsquo;t know.
But she must find out, and make peace, if possible, before
time for the garden-party to begin.</p>
<p>She looked at her watch. It was a quarter past two.
If she went right over to Susie&rsquo;s she might fix it up, and
get back in time to dress.</p>
<p>She flung off her kimono, and quickly donned a linen
suit, selecting the one she could get into most easily.</p>
<p>Then she ran down-stairs, and, without a hat or gloves,
jumped into the pony-cart, to which Dixie had been harnessed
all day, in case of errands, and drove rapidly down
the road toward Susie&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It happened that no one noticed her going, but Betty
did not think of this, so engrossed was she in the matter
in hand.</p>
<p>She dashed up to Susie&rsquo;s door and rang the bell. Mrs.
Hale herself opened the door, and from the cold, hard
expression on her face, Betty felt that she was unwelcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see Susie, Mrs. Hale,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she ready for the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Hale. &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t going
to your old party, so you can sing the solos yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Then Betty understood. Susie had wanted to sing the
solos! Betty remembered now that Susie was the soprano
of the village choir, and she probably resented Betty&rsquo;s
being asked to sing the solos instead of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, annoyed at this
foolishness, and yet relieved that it could still be set
right, &ldquo;she can sing the solos, of course! I&rsquo;d much rather
she would! Tell her so, won&rsquo;t you, and ask her to hurry
and come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale looked mollified, but she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t come now. She&rsquo;s gone to her grandma&rsquo;s
to spend the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! what a goose she is! Why couldn&rsquo;t she tell
me sooner what she wanted? Where is her grandmother&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty was looking at her watch and getting back into
the cart, and gathering up the lines, preparatory to going
after the truant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty late,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hale, glancing at the clock.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to come back here to dress, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that!&rdquo; said Betty, a little impatiently, for
she was upset over it all. &ldquo;Where is her grandmother&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, out on the Pine Hill road. The third house after
you pass the mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty groaned, for the place designated was a good two
miles away, and Dixie was somewhat tired. But she
touched him gently with the whip, and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Dixie, you&rsquo;ll help me out, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
And then they went spinning away toward the Pine Hill
road.</p>
<p>Susie, from the window, saw Betty coming, and went out
to meet her.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t look very pleasant, but Betty had no time
to waste in coaxing just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susie Hale,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;get right in this cart. Never
mind your hat; just get in this very minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie was fairly frightened at Betty&rsquo;s tones, and though
she was unwilling, she couldn&rsquo;t help doing as she was told.</p>
<p>Silent and a little bewildered, she climbed in beside
Betty, and turning quickly, they were soon flying back
over the road Betty had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourself,&rdquo; Betty began,
for she was of no mind to spare Susie&rsquo;s feelings now.
&ldquo;You, the president of the club, to cut up such a childish
caper! You can sing the solos, of course; I don&rsquo;t care a
mite! But you should have told me you wanted to sing
them, in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I wanted to?&rdquo; said Susie, weakly, now
thoroughly ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother did, and I&rsquo;m glad she did, for I never
should have guessed what foolish thing was the matter with
you. I don&rsquo;t think anybody that would act like you have is
fit to be president of a club!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s righteous indignation seemed to show Susie the
despicableness of her own conduct, and she began to cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic16">
<img src="images/i234.jpg" alt="THEY WENT SPINNING AWAY TOWARD THE PINE HILL ROAD" width="500" height="333" />
<p class="center">THEY WENT SPINNING AWAY TOWARD THE PINE HILL ROAD</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;truly I am. Can you ever forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll do just as I tell you.
First, stop crying. Second, jump out of this cart when we
get to your house, and get into your costume like lightning!
Third, come over to Denniston and take your place in the
march and sing the solos, and act pleasantly and nicely
about it. I&rsquo;ll drive home after I leave you, and I&rsquo;ll send
the cart back for you. And you must be ready! Do you
hear? You <i>must</i> be <i>ready</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty spoke almost savagely, and Susie still looked
scared, as she said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to sing your solos
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will sing them,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;You must
sing them, and do your very best, too. You sing as well
as I do, and to do as I tell you is the only way you can
make up for the trouble you&rsquo;ve stirred up. Now, here you
are at home. Fly and dress. Don&rsquo;t waste a minute. The
cart will be back for you in a quarter of an hour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie sprang out of the cart and ran into the house,
and Betty drove rapidly away to Denniston. As she tore
up the driveway among the decorated booths and lantern-hung
trees, the funny side of it struck her, and smiling
broadly, she reached the veranda, where a bewildered group
awaited her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>have</i> you been?&rdquo; cried Constance. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on an errand of mercy,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling
still; &ldquo;and nothing&rsquo;s the matter. The grand march must
be delayed a little, but I&rsquo;ll be ready in a jiffy. Come on,
Dorothy, and help me dress. Pat, please take Dixie and
go over to Mrs. Hale&rsquo;s and bring Miss Susie back with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so the grand march was delayed only about half an
hour. Susie arrived duly, and sang the solos very prettily.
Afterward, when the whole story came out, much indignation
was expressed that Betty should have been so bothered,
but Betty herself didn&rsquo;t mind, for it had the result of making
Susie her staunch friend forever after.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">X</span>
<br />BETTY CRUSOE</h2>
<p>It happened most conveniently that when Betty was invited
to spend a day and a night at Lena Carey&rsquo;s, her
mother was also just about to go for a short visit to a
friend who lived only a few stations beyond, on the same
railroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we can start together,&rdquo; said Betty, gleefully, &ldquo;and
then I can get off at Pleasant Hill, and you can go on to
Mapleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure they&rsquo;ll meet you at the station?&rdquo; said
Mrs. McGuire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. Lena wrote that they would meet me
in their new motor-car. I shall take only a suitcase,&mdash;that
will hold enough clothes for such a short stay,&mdash;then I
won&rsquo;t have to bother with a trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Betty packed a pretty organdie afternoon dress, a
dainty chiffon evening frock, and her night things, and the
two travelers started on an early morning train.</p>
<p>The Careys were in their summer home at Pleasant Hill,
and, after spending the night there, Betty was to go on
next day and join her mother at Mapleton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>The arrangement was satisfactory, as Betty would have
to travel alone only the few miles that separated the two
places.</p>
<p>It was a lovely day, and in her neat blue traveling-suit
and straw hat Betty was a very pretty and contented-looking
little tourist. She chattered to her mother all the way,
and when the train stopped at Pleasant Hill, she kissed
Mrs. McGuire good-by, and followed the porter, who carried
her suitcase from the car.</p>
<p>Betty watched the cars round the curve, and then turned
to look for the Carey motor. She didn&rsquo;t see it at first, but,
as the railroad station was set rather high, and there were
steps near by, she assumed the street was below the street-level
and she must go down the stairs.</p>
<p>But it did seem as if Lena might have come down to
welcome her, for a strange railroad station is always a bit
confusing to a new-comer.</p>
<p>Not seeing a porter, or indeed any one, about,
Betty picked up her suitcase and started down the
stairs.</p>
<p>At the bottom she saw a pleasant shaded road, but very
few signs of civilization. However, Lena had told her that
Pleasant Hill was merely a &ldquo;jumping-off place,&rdquo; but that
their own cottage there was delightful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Betty didn&rsquo;t mind the lack of people or buildings in
general, but she did mind the absence of the Careys. She
couldn&rsquo;t understand it, for she knew she was expected; but
she concluded they must have been delayed for some reason,
and she had nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>Just at that moment, she saw a man driving by in an
old farm-wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; she called, for he was nearly
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! what do you want?&rdquo; the man called back, but
he stopped his team, and waited as Betty came down the
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said politely, &ldquo;but have you seen a
motor-car around the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man ruminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, no, miss, I hevn&rsquo;t. Leastwise, not to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean to-day&mdash;just now. I&rsquo;m expecting the
Careys to meet me. I just came on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye did, hey? Well, that &rsquo;ere train was a good half-hour
late. So, if so be&rsquo;s them Careys was here, like as not they
got tired o&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; an&rsquo; went away again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Carey place, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wal, yes&rsquo;m, I do know. It&rsquo;s a matter o&rsquo; three miles
along the hill road. I&rsquo;ll take you out thar myself if ye
like. It&rsquo;ll cost you a quarter, though&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not very
busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she climbed up on the wagon-seat, and the old farmer
turned his horse and off they went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>It was mostly uphill, and therefore slow going, but at
last they came in sight of a white house nestling in a tangle
of green shrubbery and bright flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty; &ldquo;is that the Carey
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be,&rdquo; vouchsafed the taciturn one, and Betty asked no
further questions.</p>
<p>They drove in at the green, arched entrance, and up
a winding road to the house. It was a truly summery
dwelling, with large windows, wide verandas, screens and
awnings.</p>
<p>The farmer climbed slowly down from his seat, slowly
took Betty&rsquo;s suitcase and set it on the porch.</p>
<p>Leaving her suitcase on the steps, she went up on the
porch and rang the door-bell.</p>
<p>While awaiting an answer she let her gaze stray over the
surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>It was wonderfully beautiful, and, as Betty had a passion
for pure color, the clear cobalt sky, the various bright and
deep greens of the trees, the smooth gray of a little lake,
and the purple of the distant hills thrilled her color-loving
soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t have found a lovelier spot,&rdquo; thought
Betty, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; she added to herself, &ldquo;if ever I find them,
I&rsquo;ll tell them so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic17">

<p class="center">HE STOPPED HIS TEAM AND WAITED AS BETTY CAME DOWN THE STEPS</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Her ring at the bell had not been answered, and she
turned back to the front door to find it as tightly closed as
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like the Careys&rsquo; notions of hospitality,&rdquo; she said
grimly, as she rang the bell again, this time somewhat more
forcibly.</p>
<p>Still the door did not open, and Betty felt decidedly
puzzled.</p>
<p>Again she rang the bell, and could hear for herself its
long, buzzing ring. But nobody answered it, and though
she felt sure everything would soon be all right, yet she
began to feel a little queer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s the right house,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;for here&rsquo;s
Lena&rsquo;s fan in the hammock. That&rsquo;s the fan I gave her, so
she must have left the house lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly puzzled, Betty went around to the back part of
the house.</p>
<p>She knocked and banged on the kitchen door, but received
no response of any sort. She tried the door, but it was
evidently locked and would not open.</p>
<p>She peered in at a window, but all she could see was
some dishes piled on the kitchen table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do declare!&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;if this isn&rsquo;t a
lovely way to receive an invited guest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>Though unwilling to admit it, even to herself, Betty was
feeling decidedly disturbed. There was a mistake somewhere,
that was quite evident. She knew the mistake was
not hers, for Lena had written careful directions about her
journey, and had said the motor would meet the train.</p>
<p>Resolving to ring the bell again, Betty went slowly back
to the front door.</p>
<p>The landscape did not appear quite so attractive as it had
at first, and Betty was conscious of a queer depression
about her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not scared!&rdquo; she assured herself; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be
scared! They <i>must</i> be in the house. Perhaps they&rsquo;re&mdash;perhaps
they&rsquo;re cleaning the attic!&rdquo; Though not very
probable, this seemed a possibility, and Betty pushed the
bell with force enough to summon even people busily
absorbed in work. But nobody came, and in despair Betty
gave up the attic theory.</p>
<p>Half involuntarily, for she had no thought of its being
unlocked, she turned the knob of the front door. To her
surprise, it opened readily, and she stepped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for goodness&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Now,
they must be at home, or they would have locked the front
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she called: &ldquo;Lena! Lena, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no one answered, and her voice reverberated in what
was unmistakably an empty house.</p>
<p>Betty gave a little shiver. There is something uncanny
in being the only occupant of a strange house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>An undefined sense of fear took possession of her, and
she stood hesitating in the hall, almost determined to go no
farther.</p>
<p>Had it been a dull, cloudy day, or nearing dusk, she
would have scurried out, but in the bright, cheerful sunlight
it seemed absurd to feel afraid.</p>
<p>Still, it was with a loudly beating heart that she stepped
into a large room opening off the hall.</p>
<p>It was evidently the family living-room, and the familiar
things about reassured her somewhat.</p>
<p>Several books which she looked into bore Lena&rsquo;s name on
the fly-leaf, and a light shawl, which she recognized as Mrs.
Carey&rsquo;s, was flung carelessly over a chair-back. Somehow
these homelike touches comforted Betty, and she ventured
further explorations.</p>
<p>The dining-room was in order, and Betty could not tell
whether any one had eaten recently or not. But in the
kitchen pantry she noted remnants of breakfasts, which
were fresh enough to denote having been placed there that
morning. The ice-box showed fresh milk and various cold
viands, and when Betty discovered that the kitchen clock
was ticking, she concluded that all was well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For it&rsquo;s one of those little tin clocks,&rdquo; she observed,
&ldquo;that have to be wound every day. So the Careys have
just stepped out since breakfast, but why they took all the
servants with them, I don&rsquo;t know. Family picnic, I suppose,
with no thought of their arriving guest!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>Wandering back to the front rooms, Betty started to go
up-stairs, and then stopped. Suppose something awful had
happened!</p>
<p>She paused with her foot on the lowest stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lena!&rdquo; she called again, &ldquo;Lena!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no answer, and, with a sudden impulse
of bravery, Betty ran up-stairs and peeped into the first
bedroom she came to. It was, without doubt, Lena&rsquo;s own
room.</p>
<p>She recognised her kimono flung on the bed, and her
little Japanese slippers, which had evidently been kicked
off across the room. Surely Lena had dressed in a
hurry.</p>
<p>Cheered by these visible signs of her friend&rsquo;s recent
presence here, Betty went on through the other rooms.</p>
<p>She found nothing unusual, merely the sleeping-rooms
of the Carey family, fairly tidy, but by no means in spick-and-span
order.</p>
<p>In fact, they looked as if the whole family had gone away
in haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To meet me at the station, I suppose,&rdquo; cogitated Betty.
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m here, and I can&rsquo;t help it, so I may as well
make myself at home. I think I&rsquo;ll bring my suitcase up,
and select a room, and put on a cooler dress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>She went down-stairs more blithely than she had come
up. It was all very mysterious, to be sure, but there had
been no tragedy, and the Careys must come back soon,
wherever they might have gone.</p>
<p>She paused again in the living-room, and sitting down
at the open piano, she sang a few lively little songs.</p>
<p>Then, feeling quite merry over her strange experience,
she went out to the front porch for her suitcase.</p>
<p>It was just where she had left it. Nobody was in sight.
She gazed again over the lovely, serene landscape, and, taking
the suitcase, she went, singing, up-stairs.</p>
<p>The guest-room was easily recognized and Betty felt at
liberty to appropriate it for her own use. She was an
invited guest, and if no hostess or servant was present to
conduct her to her room, she must look after her own
rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just like Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; she chuckled to herself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m stranded on a desert island, with not a human being
near. But, luckily, there&rsquo;s food in the pantry, for really,
with all these exciting experiences, I&rsquo;m getting hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her suitcase and shook out her pretty dresses.
Then she changed her traveling-frock for the light
organdie, and having bathed, and brushed her hair, she felt
rather better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s nearly noon,&rdquo; she said, looking at her watch,
&ldquo;and, as I&rsquo;ve no one to consult but myself, I may as well
have an early luncheon. If the Careys come in while I&rsquo;m
eating, I&rsquo;ll invite them to lunch with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>So down-stairs Betty went, smiling to think of herself
as Betty Crusoe.</p>
<p>But as she passed the door of the living-room and glanced
inside, her smile faded.</p>
<p>Her eyes grew big with amazement, her cheeks turned
pale, and a shiver of fear shook her.</p>
<p>On the table lay a man&rsquo;s hat!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> have been there when I was in here before,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;for I looked into those books, and now the
hat&rsquo;s on top of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a forlorn old hat, of light-gray felt, but soiled
and torn, and Betty&rsquo;s frightened heart told her that it was
the hat of some marauder, and not of any member of the
Carey family.</p>
<p>With a sudden scream, which she could not repress, she
ran and hid behind a large Japanese screen in the corner of
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; called a man&rsquo;s voice from the hall.
It was a loud, gruff voice, and poor Betty shook and
shivered as she crouched behind the screen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; repeated the voice, and Betty heard
heavy footsteps coming in at the living-room door.</p>
<p>Then there was silence. The man was apparently awaiting
Betty&rsquo;s next move. Then he said again: &ldquo;Who
screamed just now? Where are you?&rdquo; and somehow this
time his voice did not sound quite so ferocious. But Betty
had no intention of answering, and she squeezed into her
corner, hoping that he would go away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Then suddenly the whimsical idea came to her that, as
she was personating Robinson Crusoe, this was probably the
Man Friday who had arrived. This amused her so much
that she giggled in spite of her fear. The man heard the
smothered sound, and going straight to the screen, he
pulled it suddenly away.</p>
<p>Betty, who was sitting on the floor, looked up to see
a stalwart young man of a college type staring down at her.
His costume of summer outing clothes was informal, but
at once betokened he was no marauder. Also, his handsome,
sunburnt face and frank blue eyes showed a kindly
though surprised expression.</p>
<p>Betty was reassured at once, and, truly glad to see a
human being of her own walk in life, her face broke into
smiles and merry dimples, as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Man Friday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; was his bewildered response, and then
remembering himself, he added: &ldquo;I beg your pardon; may
I assist you to rise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Betty&rsquo;s hand, and in a moment she had jumped
up from her crouching position, and stood facing
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Betty Crusoe,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stranded on a
desert island, and if you&rsquo;re Man Friday, I hope you&rsquo;ll
protect me from cannibals or bears or whatever wild beasts
abound here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you,&rdquo; said the young man, smiling.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Betty McGuire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I&rsquo;m a guest of the Careys&mdash;only&mdash;the Careys
don&rsquo;t seem to be here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not. I&rsquo;m Hal Pennington, at your service.
I&rsquo;m called Pen or Penny for short,&mdash;sometimes Bad
Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s a libel,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling at his kind,
honest face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, I assure you, for I&rsquo;m good as gold. Well, I, too,
am a guest of the Careys, and, as you so cleverly observe,
they don&rsquo;t seem to be here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see it was this way. All the servants took it
into their foolish heads to leave at once. They decamped
last night. So this morning the Careys started off in the
motor-car to bring home a lot of new ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t they come to the station for me, as they
arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they telegraphed you last night not to come till
next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t get the telegram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus that explains all! How did you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a rumbly old wagon of a kind farmer. The front
door wasn&rsquo;t locked, so I walked in and made myself at
home. Are you staying here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a week. I&rsquo;m sketching some bits of woodland,
and I stayed at home to-day rather than go with them
to stalk servants. Now, let me see,&mdash;this is rather a complicated
situation. Shall I, by virtue of prior residence, be
host and welcome you as my visitor, or would you rather
appropriate the house as your own, and let me be your
guest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His jolly, boyish face seemed to show that he thought
the whole affair a great joke, and Betty fell into the spirit
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do the Careys return?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carey said they&rsquo;d surely be home by three o&rsquo;clock,
and I could forage in the pantry to keep myself from
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Betty; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hostess, then, until she
comes. You&rsquo;ve heard Lena speak of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, yes! I&rsquo;ve heard you so highly lauded that
I doubt if you can live up to the angelic reputation she
gives you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll be
Betty Crusoe, and this house is my desert island. You&rsquo;re
Man Friday, and you must do exactly as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live but to obey your decrees,&rdquo; said young Pennington,
with a deep bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now, first of all, I&rsquo;m starving. Are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I even starve at your command. I am famished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are, really. Let&rsquo;s see what we can
find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they went to the pantry, and found cold chicken
and peach-pie, a bowl of custard, and various odds and ends
of tempting-looking dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set the table first,&rdquo; cried Betty, gleefully. &ldquo;Do
you know where the dishes are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never really set the table,&rdquo; Pennington said, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m quite sure the dishes are in the sideboard or the glass
cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How clever you are!&rdquo; said Betty, laughingly; &ldquo;I do
believe you&rsquo;re right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They easily found linen, silver, and glass, and Betty
set the table daintily for two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the luncheon. A man&rsquo;s only
a bother in the kitchen. You go and do your sketching
until I call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Hal Pennington was not so easily disposed of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gather some flowers, and then I&rsquo;ll
arrange them as a decoration for our feast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;that will be lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal went out to the garden, and returned with gay
blossoms, which he arranged deftly and with good taste
on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he said a little later, as he
drifted into the kitchen, where Betty, with her sleeves rolled
back, was whisking away at something in a bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making a salad; don&rsquo;t you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love it! Let me help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help, I tell you. Go away, Man Friday,
until I call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please let me help,&rdquo; coaxed Hal. &ldquo;I just love to
cook. Pooh, maybe you think I don&rsquo;t know how! See
here, I&rsquo;ll make an omelet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Betty knew what he was about he had broken
several eggs into a bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she cried, laughing at his misdirected
energy. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want an omelet! We&rsquo;ve bushels of
things to eat already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll make coffee,&rdquo; said Hal, quite unabashed.
&ldquo;These eggs will do for coffee just as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not six of them, goose!&rdquo; cried Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, you always put eggs in coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just one, or part of one, to clear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if one&rsquo;s good, more&rsquo;s better; anyway, I&rsquo;m going
to make coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a white apron from a nail, Hal tied it round
himself, and proceeded to make what turned out to be
really good coffee, though he used only a small portion
of the eggs in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good cook,&rdquo; said Betty, as she watched his
experienced movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! I learned how in camp. All our fellows know
how to cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The luncheon was daintily served. Betty had garnished
the salad with nasturtium leaves and red blossoms, and
edged the platter of cold chicken with a wreath of parsley.</p>
<p>They had taken out the Careys&rsquo; best china and cut glass,
and the table looked lovely indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! What a spread!&rdquo; said Hal, looking admiringly
at it. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you could do things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Betty, turning wondering eyes on
him. &ldquo;What made you think I couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal reddened a little, but said honestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause Lena said you&rsquo;re such a fearfully rich girl, and
I sort of thought you&rsquo;d be&mdash;oh, you know&mdash;above fussing
in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love fussing in the kitchen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I think
every girl ought to know how to cook. At least she ought
to have sense enough to get together a cold luncheon like
this when everything&rsquo;s provided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know; but you&rsquo;ve made everything look so
pretty. I want to eat dishes and all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty dimpled with pleasure at his praise, and they sat
down to the pretty feast, to which they did full justice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>

<p class="center">BETTY, WITH HER SLEEVES ROLLED BACK, WAS WHISKING AWAY AT SOMETHING IN A BOWL</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder when the Careys will come,&rdquo; Betty remarked,
as they lingered over the coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they&rsquo;d never come,&rdquo; said Hal. &ldquo;I think it
would be fine if we were really castaways, and nobody ever
came to rescue us. Just like Robinson Crusoe and his Man
Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t any goat,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing.
&ldquo;The goat was one of the principal characters, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, likely a goat would wander in some day. I say,
can you sing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling as she thought of how she
had sung when she first entered the house; &ldquo;I sing some
songs pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wager you do. Let&rsquo;s go in by the piano and sing
duets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me singing this morning? I sat down
at the piano when I first arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I was out sketching. I only came in the house a
few minutes before I found you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see your pictures, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime, yes. Let&rsquo;s go and sing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we must clear the table first. It&rsquo;s so untidy to
leave it. But you needn&rsquo;t do it; I hate to see a boy doing
girl&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, it isn&rsquo;t girl&rsquo;s work exactly, if you play
you&rsquo;re camping or picnicking or something like that. I&rsquo;m
going to help, and you can&rsquo;t stop me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal had begun already to take out the dishes, and Betty
gave him a mock sigh, as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think my Man Friday obeys me as well as he
promised to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I only obey when I want to,&rdquo; he responded, and
in a short time the table was cleared and the food put
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t wash the dishes,&rdquo; said Betty, as she piled
them neatly on the kitchen table. &ldquo;If Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s going
to bring a lot of servants at three o&rsquo;clock, they&rsquo;ll want
something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to the piano, and soon discovered that they
knew a number of the same songs.</p>
<p>Hal had a good voice, and they sang away with all their
youthful enthusiasm, making such a volume of sound that
it could be heard above the chug-chugging of the approaching
motor-car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; exclaimed Lena, as they whizzed up
to the house. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s surely Betty McGuire&rsquo;s voice! No
one else sings like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s Hal singing with her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey,
as a masculine voice blended with Betty&rsquo;s soprano.</p>
<p>Then Lena sprang from the car, and rushed to greet
Betty, and all sorts of apologies and explanations followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit sorry!&rdquo; said Hal, as Mrs. Carey reiterated
her regret at the misunderstanding; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a jolly
time, and now Lena&rsquo;s come I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll be able to
get a word in edgewise with Betty Crusoe, all the evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, if I have anything to say about it,&rdquo; said
Betty, flashing one of her brightest smiles at her Man
Friday.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">XI</span>
<br />A LABOR DAY LUNCHEON</h2>
<p>Labor Day was, of course, on Monday, and the
Saturday before Betty received this letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Boston</span>, Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Dearest Betty</span>: The loveliest thing has happened! Aunt
Evelyn has asked me to make her a little visit in New York (she
lives at the Waldorf, you know), and she says I may ask you to go
with us on a Labor Day excursion on Monday. So don&rsquo;t fail me;
I&rsquo;m crazy to see you! I&rsquo;m so excited over it all, I can scarcely
write. But this is the plan. I&rsquo;m going to New York to-morrow.
You&rsquo;re to come on Monday morning, and we&rsquo;ll meet you at the ferry&mdash;on
the New York side, you know. And then, the boat&mdash;oh, I
forgot to tell you, we&rsquo;re going to West Point&mdash;sails from somewhere
near there. But never mind that; we&rsquo;ll meet you and show you
the way. We&rsquo;re going to carry our luncheon, for Aunt Evelyn
says you can&rsquo;t get anything fit to eat on an excursion-boat. So you
can bring a contribution to the feast, or not, according to your convenience.
But be sure to come. I&rsquo;ve never been up the Hudson
River, and we&rsquo;ll have loads of fun. Take that early train from
Greenborough, and wait for us &ldquo;under the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="center">Lovingly,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Dorothy</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine, Mother?&rdquo; said Betty, as she read the
letter aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been up the Hudson either, and
it will be such fun to go with Dorothy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will, deary. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have a lovely trip.
You&rsquo;ll have to scurry out early, though, if you&rsquo;re to take
that seven-thirty train. You&rsquo;ll want to take some luncheon,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I think I ought to. Ellen will cook some of
her lovely fried chicken for me. And I might take some
stuffed eggs or some jelly tarts. I&rsquo;ll talk it over with
Ellen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Ellen was by nature what is called &ldquo;a good provider.&rdquo;
And so it happened that when Betty came down-stairs
at half-past six on Monday morning Ellen was already
packing into a big box the good things which she
had risen before daylight to prepare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, Ellen!&rdquo; cried Betty, &ldquo;do you think
I&rsquo;m going to feed the whole excursion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrah, Miss Betty,&rdquo; returned Ellen, placidly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
fine appetite ye&rsquo;ll get on the water, and yer city folks&rsquo;ll
be glad to eat yer country fixin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellen was wrapping delicious-looking bits of golden-brown
fried chicken daintily in oiled paper, and tucking
them into place in the big box.</p>
<p>Then in one corner she placed a smaller box of stuffed
eggs, which, in their individual frills of fringed white
paper, formed a pretty picture.</p>
<p>Another partition held jelly tarts, with flaky crusts and
quivering red centers, and somehow Ellen found room for
a few sandwiches, through whose thin bread showed the
yellow of mayonnaise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>Everything was carefully protected with white paper
napkins, and the whole box was a most appetizing display
of skilled culinary art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so big, Ellen,&rdquo; repeated Betty, laughing. &ldquo;I
simply can&rsquo;t carry so much stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Niver you mind, Miss Betty,&rdquo; said the imperturbable
cook, going on with her work of wrapping the big box in
neat brown paper and tying it with stout twine. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
not to walk at all, at all, and ye can get a porther to lift
it off the thrain. An&rsquo; sure Pat&rsquo;ll put it on safely fer
ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Betty submitted to the inevitable, realizing that she
wouldn&rsquo;t have to carry the box at all, and proceeded to eat
her breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an awfully big box,&rdquo; said Mrs. McGuire, as the
carriage came to the door; &ldquo;but if your party can&rsquo;t eat all
the things, you can give them to some children on the
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said Betty, and kissing her
mother good-by, she jumped into the carriage, and Pat
drove her to the train.</p>
<p>There were few passengers at that early hour, and so
there was ample room for the box on the seat beside her.
Though Betty went often to New York, she rarely went
alone, but as Dorothy and her aunt&rsquo;s family were to meet
her, she felt no responsibility as to traveling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>In Jersey City the conductor lifted the box out for her,
and a convenient porter carried it to the ferry-boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it level,&rdquo; Betty admonished him, and he touched
his red cap and said &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; and then carried the box
with greatest care. Betty went by the Twenty-third Street
Ferry, and in the ferry-house on the New York side she
was to meet Dorothy, &ldquo;under the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tryst was a well-known one, for it made a definite
place to meet in the crowded room.</p>
<p>Betty always enjoyed the long ferry, and she sat outside,
with her precious box reposing on the seat beside her.</p>
<p>The morning was delightful, but it was growing warm
and bade fair to be a very warm day.</p>
<p>Betty watched with interest the great steamer piers, and
the traffic on the river, rejoicing to think that soon she
would be sailing farther up the stream, where the banks
were green and wooded, and the expanse of water unmarred
by freight-boats and such unpicturesque craft.</p>
<p>The ferry-boat bumped into its dock at Twenty-third,
Street, and Betty picked up her box and started off with it.
A porter met her at the gangplank, and she gave it to him
with an injunction to hold it quite level. For it would be
a pity to tumble the neat arrangement of Ellen&rsquo;s goodies
into an unappetizing mass.</p>
<p>Down-stairs they went, and into the waiting-room, where
Betty paused &ldquo;under the clock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>Dorothy hadn&rsquo;t arrived, but Betty remembered, with a
smile, that she was nearly always late, so, remunerating
the porter, she sat down to wait, with her box beside
her.</p>
<p>She had on a suit of embroidered blue linen, and a
broad-brimmed straw hat trimmed with brown roses.</p>
<p>The big hat suited Betty&rsquo;s round face and curly hair,
and, all unconsciously, she made a pretty picture as she sat
there waiting. Before she had time to feel anxious about
Dorothy&rsquo;s non-appearance, a messenger-boy in uniform
came toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Miss McGuire?&rdquo; he said, touching his cap
respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Betty, wondering how he knew her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this is for you. The lady told me how you
looked, and said I&rsquo;d find you right here. No answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy turned away, and in a moment was lost in the
crowd, leaving Betty in possession of a note addressed in
Dorothy&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>She tore it open and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Waldorf-Astoria.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Dear Betty</span>: What do you think! Aunt Evelyn has a <i>fearful</i>
sick headache, and can&rsquo;t raise her head from the pillow. So, of
course, we can&rsquo;t go up the Hudson to-day, and she says for you to
come right up here, and have luncheon here, and afterward Uncle
Roger will take us to a matin&eacute;e. She said this was the surest
way to reach you, and for you not to be afraid, but just take a
taxicab and come straight here. I told her I knew you wouldn&rsquo;t be
afraid, but she said for you to telephone us as soon as you get this
note, so she&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s all right. She&rsquo;s sort of nervous about you.
So call us up right away, and I&rsquo;ll answer you.</p>
<p><span class="center">In haste,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Dorothy</span>.</span></p>
<p>P. S. I told the messenger he&rsquo;d know you because you were very
pretty, except for your turn-up nose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Betty smiled at Dorothy&rsquo;s postscript, and then she read
the note over again. On the whole, she didn&rsquo;t much care
that the plans were changed, for a luncheon at a fine hotel
and a matin&eacute;e afterward seemed quite as attractive on a
hot day as a sail on a crowded excursion-boat.</p>
<p>Also, she was not at all afraid! She laughed at the idea.
She would telephone Dorothy, and then she would really
enjoy taking a taxicab and driving up to the hotel all alone.
It made her feel decidedly grown-up.</p>
<p>So she went to the telephone booth and called up
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t mind the change of plans a bit,&rdquo; she
said, in answer to her friend&rsquo;s query. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry
for your aunt, but I think we&rsquo;ll have a better time on land
than on the water to-day. It&rsquo;s getting very warm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;It seems cool here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hot out in the sun all right. I&rsquo;ll take a taxi,
and I&rsquo;ll be with you in less than half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, come right here, and we&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.
My cousins Fred and Tom want to see you, and Aunt
Evelyn says perhaps we can go for a drive in the Park
before luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that reminds me, Dorothy. I&rsquo;ve a big box of
luncheon with me. What shall I do with it? I can&rsquo;t walk
into the Waldorf with that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, Betty, I should say not! But it&rsquo;s a shame
to throw it away. Just give it to some poor person, can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a good idea; I will. Well, good-by, till I
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by. Hurry up here,&rdquo; said Dorothy, and Betty
hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>As she picked up her box to start toward the taxicab
rank, the thought occurred to her that it might be well to
dispose of the box before she took the cab. Acting on this
idea, she stepped out of the ferry-house and looked about
her.</p>
<p>It was rapidly growing much warmer, and the glare on
the hot paving-stones was unpleasant, but Betty determined
to bestow the wholesome food on some grateful poor person
before she started up-town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find some one really worthy,&rdquo; she said to
herself; &ldquo;it would be too bad to waste all these good things
on an ungrateful wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>She looked at the newsboys who were crying their papers,
but it seemed impracticable to expect them to carry a large,
heavy box in addition to their burden of papers. She wandered
along the street until she saw a poor-looking old
woman in a news-booth.</p>
<p>The papers and magazines were piled up tidily and the
old news-vender herself sat comfortably knitting, now
and then looking out over her spectacles for a possible customer.</p>
<p>She was certainly thrifty, Betty thought, and would be
greatly pleased with a present of good food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give you this,&rdquo; said Betty, resting the box
on a pile of morning papers; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some food&mdash;nice bits of
cold chicken and eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bits of food, is it?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Broken bits
ye&rsquo;re offerin&rsquo; to me! Well, ye may be takin&rsquo; &rsquo;em back! Nobody
need dole out food to Bridget Molloy! I takes nobody&rsquo;s
charity! I earns me honest livin&rsquo;! More shame to
them as doesn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you,&rdquo; cried Betty, greatly
distressed at having hurt the old woman&rsquo;s feelings. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a very nice luncheon that I brought for myself and some
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Molloy would not listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;take yer cold victuals to
some one as is too lazy to work for a honest livin&rsquo;! I asks
no charity fer me or mine!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Greatly chagrined and a little angry, Betty picked up
her box and walked away.</p>
<p>It had been an unfortunate occurrence, but surely it
would be easy enough to find some one more reasonable
than the old newswoman. Before she had gone a block
Betty saw a ragged urchin who was, she decided, a worthy
case. He was not selling papers; indeed, he was doing
nothing, but leaning against a high board fence, digging
his bare toes into the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little thing,&rdquo; thought Betty; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt
he&rsquo;s hungry.&rdquo; Then she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, little boy. Are you one of a large
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked suspiciously at Betty, then, in a whining
voice, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten brudders an&rsquo; ten sisters ma&rsquo;am; an&rsquo; me fadder is
sick, an&rsquo; me mudder is out o&rsquo; work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you poor child!&rdquo; exclaimed Betty, and as he held
out a grimy little paw, as if for coin, she offered him the
box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the boy I&rsquo;m looking for. Here is a quantity
of nice food for you and your brothers and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the grimy little paw was withdrawn, and with
both hands behind him, the boy winked rudely at Betty
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, g&rsquo;wan! Quit yer kiddin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Betty, who couldn&rsquo;t
help laughing at the impudent little fellow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m offering
you some good food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good food nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said the strange child. &ldquo;Take
yer box away, lady; I wouldn&rsquo;t swap yer me college pin
fer it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty had to laugh at this, but since the boy was so indifferent,
she didn&rsquo;t care to give him the lunch anyhow;
so she went on to find some one else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem queer,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s nobody
about who is just the right one to give this to. There are
men working at the road, but I don&rsquo;t like to offer it to
them, they look so&mdash;so untidy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But at last she spied a little girl. Though somewhat
gaudily dressed, the child was evidently poor, for her frock
was faded and torn. She wore a string of bright beads
round her neck, and a big bow on her black hair, and she
walked with a mincing step.</p>
<p>But she was thin and looked ill nourished, so Betty
thought that at last she had found just the right beneficiary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; she said, by way of opening the
conversation, as she paused in front of the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t a settlement teacher,&rdquo; said the child.
&ldquo;Comes a settlement teacher, and I tell my name. But
you ain&rsquo;t one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Betty, smiling kindly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a settlement
teacher, but I want to give you something&mdash;something
very nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it nice you wants fer to give me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child did not look receptively inclined, but Betty
held out the big box toward her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this box of lovely luncheon, fried chicken and little
pies! Take it home to your mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned on Betty like a little fury. Her black
eyes snapped, and her whole little body shook with indignation
as she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think shame how you says! My mama wouldn&rsquo;t let
me to take whole bunches of lunch from a lady! It ain&rsquo;t
for ladies to give lunches off on the street!&rdquo; With a flirt of
her shabby little skirts, the child turned her back on Betty
and walked haughtily away.</p>
<p>It was Betty&rsquo;s first experience with that peculiar type of
dignity and self-respect, and she was bewildered at the
sudden fury of the indignant child.</p>
<p>But the box was still to be disposed of, and Betty looked
around for another opportunity. She was tempted to throw
it away, but the thought of Ellen&rsquo;s dainty morsels being
wasted was so disappointing that she resolved to try once
more anyhow.</p>

<p class="center">THE GIRL TURNED ON BETTY LIKE A LITTLE FURY</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was so hard to give food away in
town,&rdquo; she reflected, smiling grimly at her predicament.
&ldquo;Oh, I do believe it&rsquo;s going to rain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky had suddenly clouded over, and there were
portents of a coming shower. Betty looked at the clouds,
and resolved to make one more attempt to bestow her
charity, and if that failed she concluded she must throw
away the box. As Dorothy had said, she couldn&rsquo;t very well
walk into a large hotel carrying a box of luncheon. It
would look ridiculous. And even if she did have to throw
it away, she had the satisfaction of knowing she had tried
to utilize it. The drops began to fall, but they were
large and scattered, so Betty thought she had time for
one more attempt at her good work before she ran for
shelter.</p>
<p>A poor-looking man came toward her, and Betty stopped
him. She had become timid about the box by this time, so,
unconsciously, she spoke as if asking a favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like a box of nice food to take home?&rdquo;
she said, as she hesitatingly held the box out to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to give it to me?&rdquo; he asked, in such a
threatening tone that Betty recoiled a little. She thought
quickly. Here was another who would take offense at being
looked upon as an object of charity. It flashed through
her mind that if she asked him to pay a small price he
would keep his self-respect and get far more than the value
of his money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she stammered; &ldquo;I mean to sell it to you&mdash;for
ten cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed awful to ask money for it, but surely he
could pay that much, and Betty felt instinctively that he
would refuse it as a gift.</p>
<p>The man looked at her with a strange glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a license to sell things in the street?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no!&rdquo; gasped Betty, frightened now by his intent
gaze at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you quit your foolishness, lady. You move on,
you and your precious bundle, or I&rsquo;ll call a policeman and
have you arrested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She almost <i>ran</i> back to the ferry-house, concluding, as
she went, to throw away the luncheon and take a cab up to
Dorothy&rsquo;s as quickly as she could.</p>
<p>Where to throw it away was the next question. Betty
looked in vain for a refuse receptacle or ash-can. She
knew it was not allowed to throw things in the street, and
the cleanly swept pavement near the ferries showed no
resting-place for the objectionable-box.</p>
<p>There were poor-looking people about, but Betty did not
care to risk another impertinent refusal. Just as she was
about to turn into the little office to engage a taxicab, she
had a brilliant idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back on the ferry-boat,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
a ferry ticket and go through the slip and on to the boat.
Then I can throw the old box into the water, and come off
the boat again before it starts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a really good plan, and with rising spirit
Betty paid her pennies and went on the boat. She had
ample time, as the boat had just arrived and would not
go out again for several minutes. On the upper deck
Betty walked to the extreme end, and stood looking over
into the water. It seemed an awful pity to waste that
lovely luncheon, but it was getting late, and it was raining
quite steadily, so there was really nothing else to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, then, pretty little tarts and jolly good
chicken!&rdquo; said Betty, and she pushed the box over the rail.</p>
<p>Then she hurried back, and started again for the cab-stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a taxicab, please,&rdquo; said Betty to the kind-faced
official in charge, and then, &ldquo;To the Waldorf,&rdquo; she said,
as she got into the vehicle. She felt very capable and
grown-up, as she settled herself in the broad seat, and
noticed with satisfaction that the shower was almost
over.</p>
<p>But, just as the driver was about to start, a voice called,
&ldquo;Hi! hold on there!&rdquo; and running toward the cab came a
deck-hand from the ferry-boat, carrying that box!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I seen you!&rdquo; he cried to Betty, in jubilant tones; &ldquo;I
seen you get on the boat, and then I seen you drop this
box. I wuz on the lower deck, an&rsquo; I jest caught it! It
dropped out of my hand, and the corners is smashed some,
but I saved it from goin&rsquo; in the water, all the same! Here
it is, ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked so delighted at his feat that Betty couldn&rsquo;t
help smiling back at him, though deeply exasperated to
have the box on her hands again.</p>
<p>The young fellow clearly thought he had done Betty
a great favor in restoring her property, and he stood smiling,
and shifting from one foot to another, while the
cab driver obligingly waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Betty, &ldquo;he expects a reward! Imagine
paying a reward for getting that box back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she realized that the deck-hand thought it was valuable
property he had restored, so she took out her purse
and gave him a coin that sent him away grinning with
pleasure.</p>
<p>Then the cab started, and Betty sat looking at the horrid
box which had grown such a burden to her. It was
beginning to look disreputable, too. The paper was soiled
and torn, for the rain-drops had wet it, and the jar as the
box fell on the ferry-boat deck had broken the pasteboard.
Also, to Betty&rsquo;s horror, she could see tiny drops of jelly
and something yellow oozing out at the edges. The stuffed
eggs must be upset, and the warm weather had softened
the jelly tarts! It was simply impossible to carry the box
into the hotel, and it would be also impossible to leave it
in the cab.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>

<p class="center">JUST AS THE DRIVER WAS ABOUT TO START, A VOICE CALLED, &ldquo;HI! HOLD ON THERE!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>Betty was at her wits&rsquo; end, and the street corners were
flying by with annoying rapidity. Soon she would be at
the Waldorf, and she <i>must</i> dispose of that box first.</p>
<p>Fortunately no drop from its edges had soiled her
pretty dress, and if she could only rid of it, she could enter
the hotel in serene forgetfulness of all her trouble. She
was tempted simply to pitch it out of the window, but if
she did, it would break apart and scatter its contents all
over the street, and&mdash;she <i>might</i> be arrested.</p>
<p>Betty didn&rsquo;t know much about the law, but she was
almost certain it was against it, to scatter stuffed eggs and
fruit tarts along the middle of Fifth Avenue! And yet
something <i>must</i> be done!</p>
<p>She made a desperate resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop at a news-stand, please,&rdquo; she called to the driver.
The man did so, and Betty bought four newspapers. &ldquo;Go
on slowly,&rdquo; she said; and the driver obeyed. Then Betty
untied the string from the damaged box, wrapped it all
in many thicknesses of newspaper, and tied it with the
string, making a secure if very cumbersome bundle. Surveying
it with satisfaction, she called to the driver, &ldquo;Go as
fast as you can!&rdquo; and as he accelerated his speed, she
pitched the bundle out of the window. Too frightened to
look back, she huddled in a corner of the cab, scarcely
daring to think she was free at last from that hated presence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t spill in the street,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;unless
something runs over it, and if it does, my! how the eggs
will spatter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It all appealed to Betty&rsquo;s sense of humor, and, though
she was still a little scared, she couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at
her ridiculous experiences of the morning.</p>
<p>She sat up very straight, and when the cab stopped at
the hotel, she gravely alighted, paid the driver, and
marched with a dignified air up the steps and in at the
door.</p>
<p>Once inside, the first face she saw was Dorothy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>have</i> you been?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve waited
and waited! I couldn&rsquo;t telephone, &rsquo;cause I didn&rsquo;t know
where to find you. Aunt Evelyn is <i>so</i> anxious about you.
Oh, let me present my cousins, Tom and Fred Bates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two good-looking, merry-faced young men looked admiringly
at pretty Betty and made polite bows. Still full
of merriment at the remembrance of her funny morning,
Betty&rsquo;s bright eyes were twinkling, and her cheeks rosy
beneath her flower-trimmed hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said, smiling prettily at the boys,
then turning to Dorothy, she said: &ldquo;Yes, I was detained a
little; I&rsquo;ll tell you about it some other time. But I came
just now, from the ferry, in a taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I saw you drive up,&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;I was looking
out of the window. But I&rsquo;ve been there flattening my
nose against the pane for half an hour. Where were you,
Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeking my fortune,&rdquo; said Betty, teasingly; &ldquo;or,
rather, seeking to bestow fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her speech was not heard, because of a commotion
behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one!&rdquo; said a childish voice, and, to Betty&rsquo;s
horror, an employee of the hotel ushered a ragged small
boy straight toward her. The boy held in his arms a large
muddy, newspaper-covered bundle!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen you drop it out o&rsquo; yer cab, ma&rsquo;am, an&rsquo; I brung it
to yer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dirty little face gleamed with delight, and he held
the awful-looking package out toward Betty.</p>
<p>She drew back, feeling that she could not take that box
in charge again, and Fred Bates said sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean? Why are you annoying Miss
McGuire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This chap says it&rsquo;s the lady&rsquo;s property,&rdquo; explained the
clerk who was looking after the boy. &ldquo;Say the word, sir,
and we&rsquo;ll put him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid a hand on the urchin&rsquo;s shoulder, but the boy
spoke up insistently:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> hers, sir! I seen her lose it outen the cab winder,
an&rsquo; I picked it up, an&rsquo; ran to catch &rsquo;er, an&rsquo; I seen her jest
as she came in the whirligig door, an&rsquo; I got here as soon
as they&rsquo;d let me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful-looking bundle, Betty&rsquo;s!&rdquo; cried Dorothy,
in disgust. &ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t! What nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the clerk made as if to eject the boy who had
brought the bundle, and then Betty&rsquo;s sense of justice was
aroused. It was awful to claim ownership of that disreputable
piece of property, but it was worse, in her estimation,
to have an innocent boy reprimanded for doing what
he had believed to be right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> mine,&rdquo; she said bravely, though her cheeks grew
scarlet at the surprised glances cast upon her, not only by
her friends, but by strangers who happened to be passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> mine,&rdquo; she repeated, turning to the boy, &ldquo;and
you did right to bring back to me what you thought I had
lost. But I want to lose it, as it is of no use to me. So
if you will please take it away and dispose of it properly, I
will be much obliged to you, and I will give you this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty took a two-dollar bill from her purse, and offered
it to the boy, who still held the bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, lady,&rdquo; he said, flashing a grateful glance at
her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a white one, you are! Thank you, lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk smiled and bowed, and ushered the small boy
away. The urchin turned to give Betty one more admiring
look, and she smiled pleasantly at him, and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look in that box before you throw it
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he replied, grinning, and then he disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dorothy,&rdquo; said Betty, restored to equanimity,
now that the box was finally disposed of, &ldquo;let us go and
sit down quietly somewhere, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; cried Fred Bates. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most mysterious
person I ever heard of, Miss McGuire! Come right up to
our family sitting-room and relate to us the story of the
Beautiful Young Lady and her Strange Piece of Luggage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Betty, dimpling and smiling. &ldquo;Come
on, and the whole of the dramatic tale I will unfold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which she did, to a most enthusiastic and hilarious
audience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">XII</span>
<br />A LUCKY PENNY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it,&rdquo; said Jeanette, &ldquo;Betty
is the most popular girl in school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only in school,&rdquo; amended Dorothy; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the
most popular girl in our whole set. The boys all adore
her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do,&rdquo; agreed Lena Carey. &ldquo;My brother Bob
thinks she&rsquo;s just about all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three, on their way to school, had paused in front of
Betty&rsquo;s house, and she came out and joined them.</p>
<p>It was late in October. The McGuires had been back in
their city home for several weeks, and both Betty and Jack
were in school again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your ears burn, Betty?&rdquo; asked Dorothy; as they
two fell behind the other couple; &ldquo;for we&rsquo;ve been throwing
the biggest sort of bouquets at you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t hit my ears,&rdquo; said Betty, laughing.
&ldquo;What sort were they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we just said you&rsquo;re a disagreeable old thing, and
nobody loves you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; cried honest Jeanette, turning
her head. &ldquo;We all agreed that you&rsquo;re a general favorite
and the boys like you better than they do any of the rest of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare me blushes!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;Which of the boys
confided this startling news to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we can see it,&rdquo; said Lena, &ldquo;but, to make
sure, I asked Brother Bob. I said, says I, &lsquo;Which girl do
you like best of all our set?&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;Why, Betty, of
course,&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t everybody?&rsquo; and I said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lena, you goose!&rdquo; said Betty, but she was unable
to repress a pleased smile at her friends&rsquo; talk.</p>
<p>It was really true, Betty had become a prodigious favorite
among the circle of Boston young people with whom she
associated. She was so whole-souled and good-hearted, so
ready to help everybody, so merry and full of fun, and
withal so unostentatious and simple-mannered, that nobody
could help liking her.</p>
<p>And though only a little over sixteen years old, an innate
spirit of coquetry had begun to show itself, and her dark,
roguish eyes and dimpling smile often captivated the
boys who belonged to what the school-girls called &ldquo;our
set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not that Betty was really romantic. Her coquetry was
more mischievous than sentimental, and, though she loved
to tease, her warm, generous nature never allowed the
teasing to hurt the feelings of another. It was an open
secret that both Harry Harper and Ralph Burnett were
especial admirers of Betty, and, in an amicable, good-natured
way, were rivals for her favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>But Betty was impartial, and at dancing-school or at
the little &ldquo;neighborhood parties&rdquo; would accept attentions
equally from both.</p>
<p>However, Betty&rsquo;s popularity was only a matter of degree,
and gay, laughing Dorothy, lovely, quiet Jeanette,
and pretty Lena Carey were also favorites in school and
out. As the quartet walked along, Lena said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a lovely secret to tell you, but as we&rsquo;re almost at
school now, I think I&rsquo;ll leave it until recess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, tell us now!&rdquo; clamored the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! but you&rsquo;re curious!&rdquo; teased Lena. &ldquo;No, I
won&rsquo;t tell you now, but I&rsquo;ll tell you part of it. Just enough
to stir up your curiosity a little more. I&rsquo;m going to have
a party!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was indeed interesting, but not another word would
Lena tell, and so all the morning the three eager girls
could only wonder what sort of a party it was to be, and
how big, and when, and a thousand other important questions.</p>
<p>But at recess the four gathered in a corner of the school-yard,
and Lena expounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Hallowe&rsquo;en party,&rdquo; she said, and then had to wait
for their delighted exclamations to pause before she could
proceed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en is a week from Friday,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and
Mother said last night that I could have a party if I liked.
So Bob and I talked it over, and we decided that a ghost
party would be fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a ghost party?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, just a phantom party!&rdquo; exclaimed the three listeners
all at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t planned it much,&rdquo; said Lena, &ldquo;because
I thought it would be more fun for us to plan it
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a duck you are!&rdquo; cried Betty. &ldquo;I love to plan
parties! Can we wear fancy costumes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s be witches,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;We ought to on
Hallowe&rsquo;en, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witches or ghosts, either, would be all right,&rdquo; put in
Jeanette. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll have all the old Hallowe&rsquo;en
tricks, Lena?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bob and I said we didn&rsquo;t want to have those
foolish old games, like bobbing for apples and melting lead.
They&rsquo;re so tiresome. But I thought we could make up some
new fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; declared Betty. &ldquo;Anything ghosty or
witchy, or any sort of fortune-telling, you mean, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Do you know any new tricks of that sort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I do, but we can make some up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>They all knew Betty&rsquo;s cleverness in making up games,
so they felt sure something could be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the school-bell,&rdquo; said Lena. &ldquo;You all come
to my house this afternoon, and we&rsquo;ll plan it all out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls agreed to this, and then they returned to the
school-room, where, I am sorry to say, their rebellious pencils
persisted in drawing witches or broomsticks, instead
of copying the plaster cast of a classic leaf form which was
their task for the day.</p>
<p>Not only that afternoon but several others were spent
in arranging the details of the Hallowe&rsquo;en party.</p>
<p>Jeanette, who was inclined to the serious rather than
the grotesque, favored the idea of the guests appearing
as Druids, who, she said, were really the originators of
Allhallowe&rsquo;en.</p>
<p>But Dorothy declared that Druids were poky old things
and that witches were lots more fun.</p>
<p>So, as Betty and Lena insisted on ghosts, the invitations
were finally compiled to read like this:</p>
<p class="center">DRUIDS, WITCHES, AND GHOSTS
<br /><span class="small">ARE INVITED TO ASSEMBLE AT THE HOME OF</span>
<br />MISS LENA CAREY
<br /><span class="smaller">AND</span>
<br />MR. ROBERT CAREY
<br /><span class="small">ON ALL HALLOWE&rsquo;EN OCTOBER THIRTY-FIRST</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">AT EIGHT O&rsquo;CLOCK</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>This gave the guests ample choice of costume, and if
they chose they could come simply draped in sheets and
pillow-cases, as at the old-time phantom parties.</p>
<p>Betty, after much deliberation, decided to wear a witch&rsquo;s
costume.</p>
<p>And very becoming it proved. The skirt of scarlet silk
was sprinkled with strange hieroglyphics and mystic signs
which had been cut from black silk and pasted on. The
pointed scarlet bodice was laced up over a soft white neckerchief,
and over all was a long black cloak lined with red.
Then she had a high, peaked hat, made after the most approved
style for witches, and on her shoulder was perched
a toy cat. This furry animal was of most lifelike effect,
and his green eyeballs blared by reason of tiny electric
lights concealed in his head. Betty carried a broomstick
wound with red ribbons, and, with high-heeled red shoes,
she made a complete picture of the traditional witch.</p>
<p>Jack was a ghost. But he disdained the idea of a ghost
in white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want a real ghost&rsquo;s robe. It must be
made of thin, almost transparent, fluttery stuff&mdash;yards
and yards of it&mdash;and of a sort of brownish smoke color.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Mrs. McGuire caught his idea, and herself fashioned a
voluminous robe of smoke-colored chiffon. It was made
something like a college gown, but there were several of
them, and after donning a sort of ulster-shaped garment
of dull brown muslin, Jack put on one after another of the
floppy gauze robes. The effect was fine. The least breath
of air sent the shimmering material into billowy waves,
and the &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; almost seemed to disappear at times. A
deep cowl-like hood nearly concealed his face, and made
his features dim and indistinguishable, and when Jack
stalked about with theatrical stride, and gave voice to fearful,
hollow groans, he seemed as fine a ghost as one could
wish.</p>
<p>Jeanette and Constance had chosen to wear Druid&rsquo;s
costume, and, as several others had like taste, quite a number
of shapes in flowing classic raiment lent their dignified
effect to the party. There were many white ghosts, some
weird and terrible ones, several witches and wizards, and
many nondescript costumes.</p>
<p>The guests assembled on time, as all were anxious not to
miss any of the fun.</p>
<p>When Betty and Jack arrived at the Carey house and
rang the door-bell, the door swung slowly open, and though
no one was in sight, a sepulchral groan greeted them.
Then a strange-looking, cloaked figure, with a lighted Jack-o&rsquo;-lantern
for a head, ushered them into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Betty herself had helped to arrange this room, but when
the party began, it looked even more effective than when
they had decorated it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<div class="img" id="pic21">
<img src="images/i289.jpg" alt="A STRANGE-LOOKING, CLOAKED FIGURE, WITH A LIGHTED JACK-O&rsquo;-LANTERN FOR A HEAD, USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM" width="500" height="727" />
<p class="center">A STRANGE-LOOKING, CLOAKED FIGURE, WITH A LIGHTED JACK-O&rsquo;-LANTERN FOR A HEAD, USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING-ROOM</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>The room was very dimly lighted, and the walls had been
hung with black muslin on which were painted grinning
skulls and cross-bones in gleaming white. The big wood
fire at one end of the room shone through a screen of red
transparent stuff, which gave a crimson glow to the room.</p>
<p>Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns were all about, and the candles inside
them lit up the grotesque faces of the pumpkins.</p>
<p>Bob Carey, who announced that he was the ghost of
Hamlet&rsquo;s father, introduced the other ghosts to each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he would say, indicating a sheeted figure, &ldquo;is
the ghost of Banquo. We used to play together as boys.
And here is the ghost of a man who died a-laughing. You
will observe his laughter when I tickle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ghost, when tickled, would give howls of demoniac
laughter, in which the other guests involuntarily joined.</p>
<p>When all the weird-looking figures had assembled, the
fun began.</p>
<p>Another room had been prepared as a fortune-telling
room, and into this each guest was invited to go, alone, to
learn his or her fate.</p>
<p>Just who was the fortune-teller was a great secret. No
one outside of the Carey family knew who it was who
greeted the seekers for knowledge as they entered one by
one.</p>
<p>But apparently the strange being knew his clients, for
many jokes and secrets were exposed, and often the victim
came out giggling, but looking a trifle sheepish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>Jack was really very fond of Dorothy. Indeed, she was
his favorite of all the girls&mdash;after Betty, of course.</p>
<p>So, when Dorothy went into the Room of the Fates to
learn what future fortune might befall her, and came out
holding a card in her hand, the others clamored to know
what had been told her.</p>
<p>Dorothy looked mysterious and refused to tell, but when
the boys and girls insisted on seeing what talisman had
been given her, and she showed the card, a roar of laughter
went up from all. It was a playing-card, the jack of hearts,
and ghostly Jack himself seemed quite satisfied with the
episode.</p>
<p>Every one who went into the Room of the Fates
returned with a talisman indicative of their future
career.</p>
<p>It might be a doctor&rsquo;s diploma or a fireman&rsquo;s badge. It
might be a thimble, indicating spinsterhood, or a spray
of orange-blossom, indicating matrimony. But in every
case the souvenir bore sufficient meaning to prove that the
fate-dispenser was some one who knew the individual traits
of his auditors.</p>
<p>When it was Betty&rsquo;s turn, she entered the Fate Room, determined
to guess, if possible, who the wizard was. All
of the young people of their set were in evidence as guests,
so the mysterious fortune-teller must be some older person
or a stranger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>As Betty entered, she was met by three draped figures,
representing the three Fates.</p>
<p>These, she knew, were Harry Harper, Ralph Burnett,
and Elmer Ellis, for she and Lena had invited these boys to
act these parts.</p>
<p>They were robed in brown, flowing draperies, which they
did not manage in classic fashion, but kicked about in derision.
One carried a distaff, one a ball of cord, and one a
pair of shears, in imitation of the traditional three. The
room was draped with white sheets, and at the far end was
a sort of throne on which sat the Master of the Fates. He
was gorgeously robed in a scarlet satin suit and a purple
velvet cape edged with ermine. A flowing white wig,
bushy white beard and eyebrows, completely disguised
his features, while a high, peaked hat added to his wizardy
effect.</p>
<p>Grouped about him were a globe, a map of the stars, a
divining-wand, a great Book of Fate, and all sorts of mysterious-looking
instruments and paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Bats, cut out of paper, swung by invisible threads from
the ceiling, and were set fluttering by sly puffs from
bellows by the three Fates, who scampered about, on mischief
bent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>In the white room were several black cats also. These
added greatly to the weird effect, and, as they were good-natured
old tabbies that Lena had borrowed from neighbors,
they just stalked about and lay dozing in the white-draped
chairs.</p>
<p>The three Fates ushered Betty with great pomp and
ceremony to the chair facing the wizard, and begged her to
be seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you most want to know?&rdquo; droned out
the magician, as he gravely wagged his head at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you are!&rdquo; said Betty, so suddenly that he fairly
jumped.</p>
<p>At this the three Fates doubled up in gleeful antics, but
the wizard recovered himself, and continued in slow, deep
tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you may know sometime, but not now. I will
now foretell your fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Betty, wondering where she had heard that
full, deep voice before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have strange adventures awaiting you. You will
travel by land and sea, and great good fortune shall be ever
yours. In the years to come, you will meet your destiny.
The stars ordain that a fitting mate shall claim you, but it
will be neither of the two Fates who are now dogging your
footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Harry and Ralph gave forth despairing groans
and pretended to pommel one another. Betty giggled, but
the wizard remained grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you may know your fate,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I give
you this talisman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Betty had no mind to be teased as Dorothy had
been, and receiving the talisman from the wizard, she
slipped it into her pocket.</p>
<p>Then, as the wizard dismissed her, she rose to take
leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst not depart until thou shalt exhibit thy
talisman,&rdquo; said Harry Harper, striking a dramatic attitude
before the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I mayst,&rdquo; said Betty. &ldquo;Avaunt thee, Fate,
and let me pass, or I cast o&rsquo;er thee my magic spell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Already hast thou done that,&rdquo; said Harry, his tone
exaggeratedly sentimental.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the witch pass!&rdquo; interrupted Elmer Ellis, and,
amid the chuckling exclamations of the three, Betty departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you get?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your talisman?&rdquo; cried
those who awaited her. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see your fate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Betty laughingly showed her empty hands, and could
not be persuaded to admit that she had received anything.
But as soon as she could get a moment unobserved, she took
out her talisman to examine it.</p>
<p>It was a bright new cent, dated the present year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Betty to herself, &ldquo;a penny! Hal Pennington!
I <i>thought</i> I had heard that voice before! What
a little witch Lena is, to keep it so secret! I never dreamed
of his coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty was glad he had come, for though they had met
only a few times, they were good friends, and it was a compliment
indeed that he had given her himself as a fate!
Of course it was just for that evening, and Betty thought
it was very jolly.</p>
<p>With shining eyes and rosy cheeks, she rejoined the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play a joke on Betty,&rdquo; said Dorothy to Jeanette,
as it neared supper-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way. Lena says we girls each have to select our
partner for supper. She says she won&rsquo;t have the old-fashioned
way of pairing off by matched nuts or flowers or
things. Each girl has to ask a boy herself. Now, of course,
nobody will ask the boy she really likes best. I wouldn&rsquo;t
myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Jeanette, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the joke on Betty,
then? She won&rsquo;t ask either Harry or Ralph, and we
know she likes them best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it! Of course Lena will make her choice
last, as she&rsquo;s hostess. Let&rsquo;s fix it so Betty will be next to
last, and let&rsquo;s leave those two boys till the last. Then Betty
will <i>have</i> to choose one or the other of them, and that will
be a good joke on her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it will! And it isn&rsquo;t a mean joke, either. If there
are only those two, she&rsquo;ll have to select one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we be sure nobody else chooses either
Harry or Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody will. They&rsquo;ll know enough to leave them
for Betty. But I&rsquo;ll whisper to Constance and a few of
the girls to make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scheme worked well. Lena, in burlesque authority,
ordered each fair damsel to choose the knight she most
admired, to escort her to supper.</p>
<p>This made great fun, as each girl deliberately ignored
the boy she liked best, and chose a brother or a comparative
stranger. Betty had made up her mind to choose
Jack, and thus evade an embarrassing decision between her
two admirers.</p>
<p>But, as one girl after another was called, Betty began
to surmise there was some joke in progress.</p>
<p>But Lena said to her, casually, &ldquo;You and I will go
last, Betty,&rdquo; and so she really suspected little.</p>
<p>But at last no boys were left but Ralph and Harry, and,
as Lena announced with twinkling eyes that Betty must
make her choice, she saw at once that the girls had pre-arranged
this.</p>
<p>It was a difficult situation. Betty had no wish to offend
either boy by choosing the other, and she was decidedly in
a quandary. She stood looking at them and smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard to choose between you,&rdquo; she said, provokingly,
but really to gain time. Suddenly she bethought
herself of the penny in her pocket! Ah, here was a way
to circumvent those mischievous girls!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t
choose either of you very gentlemanly appearing boys. But
my Fate was foretold me, and the talisman that I have
here bids me await the coming of the knight appointed for
me by Destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty held up her bright penny with a roguish look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Lena, who knew
nothing of what Hal had said to Betty in the Room of the
Fates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here he comes! Here&rsquo;s the Bad Penny, who always
turns up when he&rsquo;s wanted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hal was just entering the room, his first appearance
except in his disguise as &ldquo;Fate.&rdquo; He had removed the
uncomfortable wig and whiskers, but still wore the gorgeous
costume.</p>
<p>The smile with which Betty greeted him quite took away
the sting of being called a Bad Penny, and he said
gaily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Lucky Penny, rather, to be chosen by such a merry
witch!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>So the girls were foiled in their little plot, and Lena, accepting
her defeat good-naturedly, declared she had to
choose both the remaining knights, and taking an arm of
each, she followed the procession to the dining-room.</p>
<p>The feast was abundant and the guests very merry.
More fortune-testing was provided in the mottoes and snapdragon,
and at last the &ldquo;fortune-cake&rdquo; was cut.</p>
<p>This great confection was almost like a bride-cake,
save that its frosting was red and chocolate instead of
white.</p>
<p>It was decorated with tiny witches and black cats, which
were, of course, confectionery, and candles were burning
all round it.</p>
<p>In it had been baked a thimble, signifying spinsterhood;
a gold ring, betokening matrimony; a penny, meaning
wealth; a gold pen for literary fame; a button for a
bachelor; and many other tiny emblems of fortune, which
were arranged only one to a slice.</p>
<p>By dint of clever man&oelig;uvering Lena arranged that Betty
should get the slice with the penny in it, and this caused a
shout of laughter at Betty&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t mind, and only glanced merrily at
Hal, as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to be irrevocably fated, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied to have it so,&rdquo; he replied gallantly, making
a gesture like a real stage suitor; and Betty returned
saucily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I&mdash;during supper-time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>After supper they assembled in the &ldquo;black room&rdquo; for a
fagot party.</p>
<p>The screen was removed from the blazing wood fire, and
all sat on the floor, or on cushions or ottomans clustered
round the big fireplace.</p>
<p>Each was given a &ldquo;fagot,&rdquo; a bundle of tiny sticks tied
together with red and black ribbons, and each, in turn,
threw the fagot into the fire. While the fagot burned, the
thrower was to tell a ghost story, which must stop as soon
as the sticks were entirely consumed.</p>
<p>This was a most exasperating performance, for in nearly
every instance, just as the thrilling climax of the story was
nearly reached, the sticks burned out, and the narrator was
not allowed to proceed.</p>
<p>Hal Pennington&rsquo;s was one of the most interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is a fearful tale,&rdquo; he said, as he threw his fagot
on the fire, &ldquo;and I will tell it rapidly that you may all
hear the marvelous and almost incredible <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others crowded closer to hear, for Hal spoke in low,
mysterious tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a house up on Cape Cod,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;an old-fashioned,
rambling sort of house, that was said to be
haunted. It had long borne this reputation, and one room
in particular, a small room at the end of a long ball-room,
was said to be the room where the ghost appeared. The
people who told about it always shuddered, and refused to
tell what horrible shapes the ghost assumed when it made
itself visible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>Harry Harper gave a scared sort of gasping groan, and
then the other boys groaned dismally, while the girls shivered
and giggled both at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of us fellows,&rdquo; went on Hal, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t believe in
this ghost, and we decided to spend a night in the old house
and test it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did no one live in the house?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; it hadn&rsquo;t been occupied for years, because of
the ghost. Well, eight of us went there one evening, and
one, Phil Hardy, said he would go into the haunted room
and lock himself in, and we others must keep watch in the
ball-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he lock himself in?&rdquo; asked Lena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he thought the ghost was some person playing
a trick on us. He wasn&rsquo;t afraid of a ghost, but he was of a
real marauder. So we other boys stayed in the big, dark,
empty ball-room. That is, it was nearly empty&mdash;only a
few chairs and sofas ranged against the wall. We hid behind
these, having previously locked all the doors. You
see, we were willing to receive the ghost, but we didn&rsquo;t
care to have burglars coming in. The story was that the
ghost came from the hall into the ball-room, traversed the
full length of that, and then entered the little anteroom
where Phil was keeping watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time we crouched silently behind our chairs,
and then&mdash;then we heard the latch of the door click! We
knew it was securely locked, but our hair rose on our
heads as we heard it open and close again. Then footsteps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hollow footsteps!&rdquo; interrupted Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, hollow footsteps&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And clanking chains,&rdquo; put in Harry, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, who&rsquo;s telling this?&rdquo; demanded Hal.
&ldquo;Well, hollow footsteps and clanking chains resounded on
our ears, as we heard the ghost glide the full length of that
long room!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half scared to death, we peeped out from behind our
chairs, but could see nothing, though we all heard the footsteps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, though it didn&rsquo;t move, we heard the door open
into the room where Phil was, and close again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We trembled and turned cold with a mysterious horror,
when suddenly an awful shriek broke the silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a breathless pause, and then Betty exclaimed:
&ldquo;Oh, what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; said Hal; &ldquo;my fagot has burned
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fraud!&rdquo; cried Lena; &ldquo;you timed it so on
purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I did,&rdquo; said Hal, smiling; &ldquo;anyhow, there
isn&rsquo;t a word of truth in my yarn, and I confess I didn&rsquo;t
know quite how to end it up myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! that&rsquo;s no sort of a ghost story!&rdquo; said Lena,
but the others all agreed that it was the best one, and Hal
must have the prize.</p>
<p>Then the party broke up, and the ghosts and witches
went for their more prosaic hats and wraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no; Jack will take care of me,&rdquo; said Betty,
as Hal Pennington asked to escort her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then mayn&rsquo;t I go to see you to-morrow?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Remember, you chose me to-night in preference to your
two devoted swains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was to disguise my real preference,&rdquo; said Betty,
roguishly; &ldquo;and, besides, I had to choose you, because it
was so decreed by Fate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a true word spoken in jest,&rdquo; declared
Hal, theatrically, and taking a couple of stagy strides
across the hall with eyes rolled up to the ceiling; and then,
after a chorus of general good nights, Betty and Jack went
home.</p>
